<p>Configuration management in Kubernetes (K8s) is the process of defining and managing the configuration of your applications running in a K8s cluster. K8s provides several mechanisms for managing configuration, including ConfigMaps and Secrets, and supports several ways to inject configuration into your applicationâ€™s containers. Configuration management is tightly integrated with other Kubernetes features and is critical for building scalable and reliable applications in Kubernetes.</p>
