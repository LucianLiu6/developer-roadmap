<p>Kubernetes secrets store sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, and API keys in a secure manner. They can be created manually or automatically, and stored in etcd. Secrets can be mounted as files or environment variables in a pod, and access can be managed using Kubernetes RBAC. However, they have some limitations, such as size and the inability to be updated once created. Understanding secrets is important for building secure applications in Kubernetes.</p>
