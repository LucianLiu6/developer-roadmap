<p>Networking is crucial for communication between pods and resources in a Kubernetes cluster. Each pod has a unique IP address and can communicate with other pods directly. Container networking interface (CNI) plugins are used to configure pod network interfaces and provide isolation between pods. Kubernetes also provides networking services such as load balancing, service discovery, and ingress, which enable external traffic to access pods and services. These services are implemented using Kubernetes objects such as Services, Ingress, and NetworkPolicies. Networking and pod-to-pod communication are essential for scalability, reliability, and flexibility in Kubernetes clusters.</p>
