<p>Services and networking are key components that enable communication between pods and external clients. Services provide a stable endpoint for accessing a set of pods, while networking plugins and configuration options enable pod-to-pod communication and network isolation. These features are designed to be scalable, reliable, and flexible, making it easier for developers to manage and orchestrate complex microservices architectures. Additional features like Ingress and DNS-based service discovery provide flexible external access to services and simplify service discovery within a cluster.</p>
