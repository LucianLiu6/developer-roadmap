<p>In Kubernetes, a pod is the smallest deployable unit that represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and can access the same storage volumes. Pods are created and managed by Kubernetes, and they are scheduled to run on one of the nodes in the cluster. Pods provide a lightweight and flexible abstraction layer that enables Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized applications. Pods also facilitate the communication and data exchange between containers running in the same pod.</p>
