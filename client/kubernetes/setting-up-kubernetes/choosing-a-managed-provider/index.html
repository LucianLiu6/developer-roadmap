<p>A managed provider is a cloud-based service that provides a managed Kubernetes environment. This means that the provider handles the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking, as well as the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>When choosing a managed Kubernetes provider, consider the cloud provider you are using, features and capabilities, pricing and billing, support, security and compliance, and the providerâ€™s reputation and reviews. By taking these factors into account, you can select a provider that meets your needs and offers the best value for your organization.</p>
