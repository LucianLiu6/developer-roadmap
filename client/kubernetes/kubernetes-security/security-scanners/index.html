<p>Kubernetes security scanners help identify vulnerabilities and potential security threats in container images before deployment. Popular options include Aqua Security, Twistlock, Sysdig Secure, Trivy, Anchore Engine, and OpenSCAP. These scanners offer a variety of features such as vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and runtime protection for Kubernetes environments. By integrating these scanners into their pipelines, organizations can ensure the security and integrity of their Kubernetes deployments and minimize the risk of security breaches and data loss.</p>
