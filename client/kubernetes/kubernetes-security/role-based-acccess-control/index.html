<p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of controlling access to Kubernetes resources based on the roles assigned to users or groups. RBAC involves creating roles and binding them to users or groups to control access to Kubernetes resources. Roles are defined as a set of rules that determine what actions can be performed on specific resources. By assigning roles to users or groups, access to Kubernetes resources can be restricted or granted based on the permissions defined in the role. RBAC helps ensure the security and integrity of Kubernetes clusters by limiting access to authorized users and groups.</p>
