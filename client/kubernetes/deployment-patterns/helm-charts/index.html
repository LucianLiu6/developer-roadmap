<p>Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications through the use of reusable and versioned Helm charts. These charts are composed of YAML files that describe related sets of Kubernetes resources and can be customized using values files and templating with Go templates. Helm charts can also have dependencies on other charts and be stored in a centralized repository like Helm Hub for easy sharing and access. By utilizing Helm, teams can streamline application management and reduce duplication of effort.</p>
