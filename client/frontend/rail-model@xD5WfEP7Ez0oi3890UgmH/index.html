<p>The RAIL model is a performance optimization model for web applications that focuses on improving the perceived performance of a web page. It stands for Response, Animation, Idle, and Load, and it involves the following four performance goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response: The time it takes for the web page to respond to user input should be under 100 milliseconds.</li>
<li>Animation: The time it takes for an animation to run should be under 10 milliseconds.</li>
<li>Idle: The web page should take advantage of idle time to perform non-critical tasks.</li>
<li>Load: The time it takes for the web page to fully load should be under 1 second.</li>
</ul>
<p>The RAIL model is designed to provide a framework for optimizing the performance of a web page by focusing on the four key areas that impact the userâ€™s perception of performance. It is particularly useful for applications that require high levels of interactivity, such as games and social media applications.</p>
