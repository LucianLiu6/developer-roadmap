<p>Most of the browsers have built-in developer tools that help you perform web development specific tasks on a webpage. My personal recommendation would be to use Chrome DevTools as it is the most advanced and has the most features. However, if you are using a different browser, you can still use the DevTools to debug your web application.</p>
<p>Chrome DevTools is a set of web development tools built into the Google Chrome browser. It allows web developers to debug and optimize web pages by providing a range of features for inspecting and manipulating the page’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Some of the features provided by Chrome DevTools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements panel</strong>: Inspect and modify the page’s HTML and CSS.</li>
<li><strong>Console panel</strong>: View and debug JavaScript errors and log messages.</li>
<li><strong>Network panel</strong>: Monitor network requests and responses, and analyze performance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Performance panel</strong>: Analyze the performance of the page and identify bottlenecks.</li>
<li><strong>Application panel</strong>: Inspect the page’s resources, such as cookies and local storage.</li>
</ul>
