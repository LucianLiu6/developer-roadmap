<p>Web Sockets is a technology that allows for full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between a client and a server, and is typically used in applications that require high-speed, low-latency communication, such as online gaming and real-time data streaming.</p>
<p>Web Sockets utilizes a persistent connection between a client and a server, allowing for continuous data exchange without the need for the client to send additional requests to the server. This makes it more efficient and faster than other technologies, such as HTTP, which require a new request to be sent for each piece of data.</p>
<p>Web Sockets is supported by most modern web browsers and can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.</p>
