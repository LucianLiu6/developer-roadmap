<p>Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows a set of principles that are designed to make the code more readable, testable, and less error-prone. Some of the key principles of clean code include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity: The code should be easy to read and understand.</li>
<li>Simplicity: The code should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity.</li>
<li>Comments: Comments should be used sparingly and only when necessary to explain complex or non-obvious code.</li>
<li>Naming: Variables, functions, and classes should have meaningful and descriptive names.</li>
<li>Formatting: The code should be consistently formatted to improve readability.</li>
<li>Functionality: The code should be organized into small, single-purpose functions and classes.</li>
<li>Error handling: The code should handle errors in a consistent and predictable way.</li>
<li>Testing: The code should be testable and have a high test coverage.</li>
<li>Reusability: The code should be designed to be reusable and modular.</li>
<li>Performance: The code should be designed to be efficient and performant.</li>
</ul>
