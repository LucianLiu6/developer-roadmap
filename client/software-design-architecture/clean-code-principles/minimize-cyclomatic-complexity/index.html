<p>Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of a program, which is determined by the number of linearly independent paths through a program’s control flow. High cyclomatic complexity can make a program difficult to understand, test, and maintain, so it’s often desirable to minimize it in system architecture.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to minimize cyclomatic complexity in system architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down complex functions into smaller, simpler functions that perform specific tasks.</li>
<li>Use control structures, such as if-else statements and loops, in a consistent and predictable way.</li>
<li>Use functional programming concepts and techniques, such as immutability and pure functions, to reduce the need for complex control flow.</li>
<li>Use design patterns, such as the state pattern, to simplify complex control flow.</li>
<li>Regularly review the code and refactor it to simplify the control flow.</li>
<li>Use static code analysis tools that can detect and report high cyclomatic complexity in the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, the system architecture will be more maintainable, testable, and less error-prone.</p>
