<p>Creating abstractions is an important part of software development, but creating too many abstractions or creating them too early can lead to unnecessary complexity and make the code harder to understand and maintain.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to avoid hasty abstractions in system architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the problem that needs to be solved before creating an abstraction.</li>
<li>Start with a simple solution and only create an abstraction when it becomes clear that the solution is becoming too complex.</li>
<li>Use code refactoring techniques to simplify the code before creating an abstraction.</li>
<li>Avoid creating abstractions for the sake of creating abstractions.</li>
<li>Use established design patterns and practices when creating abstractions, but do not force them into the code.</li>
<li>Use automated testing to ensure that the abstraction does not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.</li>
<li>Create abstraction in a way that itâ€™s easy to test, debug, and reason about.</li>
</ul>
