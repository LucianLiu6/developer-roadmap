<p>Indentation is the practice of using whitespace to visually group related lines of code together, making it easier to read and understand the structure of the code. Code style refers to the conventions and guidelines used to format and structure code, such as naming conventions, commenting, and use of whitespace.</p>
<p>Having a consistent indentation and code style can help to make the code more readable and understandable, which can improve the maintainability of the system.</p>
