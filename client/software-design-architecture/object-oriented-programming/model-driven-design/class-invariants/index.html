<p>A class invariant is a set of conditions that must be true for any object of a class, at any point in time. In object-oriented programming (OOP), class invariants are used to define the valid states of an object and to ensure that the object always remains in a valid state.</p>
<p>Class invariants are typically defined in the constructor of a class and are enforced through the use of private methods and data members that are used to validate the state of the object. They are also checked in the classâ€™s methods before and after any operation that can change the state of the object.</p>
