<p>Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. This is achieved by defining a common interface for all classes that need to be treated polymorphically. The word polymorphism is derived from Greek, “poly” means many and “morph” means form.</p>
<p>There are two types of polymorphism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time polymorphism (also called static polymorphism or early binding) occurs when the type of the object that is going to be acted upon is determined at compile-time. This is achieved through method overloading, which allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters within the same class.</li>
<li>Run-time polymorphism (also called dynamic polymorphism or late binding) occurs when the type of the object is determined at run-time. This is achieved through method overriding, which allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.</li>
</ul>
