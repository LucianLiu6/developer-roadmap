<p>A concrete class is a class in object-oriented programming (OOP) that can be instantiated, meaning objects can be created from it. A concrete class is a class that provides an implementation for all of the abstract methods declared in its parent class, if it inherits from an abstract class. A concrete class can also be a class that does not inherit from an abstract class, in that case it can have implementation for all of its methods.</p>
<p>Concrete classes are used to provide specific implementation details for a group of related classes that inherit from a common abstract class. They are also used to define unique behavior for a specific class. A concrete class can have its own methods and variables, and can also override the methods of its parent class.</p>
