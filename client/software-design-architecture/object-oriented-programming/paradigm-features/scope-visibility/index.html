<p>Scope visibility refers to the accessibility or visibility of variables, functions, and other elements in a program, depending on the context in which they are defined. In object-oriented programming (OOP), scope visibility is controlled through the use of access modifiers, such as “public,” “private,” and “protected.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Public: A public element can be accessed from anywhere in the program, both within the class and outside of it.</li>
<li>Private: A private element can only be accessed within the class in which it is defined. It is not accessible to other classes, even if they inherit from the class.</li>
<li>Protected: A protected element can only be accessed within the class and its subclasses.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are variations of scope visibility based on the programming language, but these are the most common.</p>
