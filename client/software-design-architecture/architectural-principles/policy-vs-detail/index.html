<p>In software architecture, the distinction between <strong>policy</strong> and <strong>detail</strong> refers to the separation of high-level decisions and low-level implementation details.</p>
<p>Policy refers to the high-level decisions that define the overall behavior and structure of the system. These decisions include things like the overall architecture, the system’s interface, and the major components and their interactions. Policy decisions are often made by architects and designers, and they set the overall direction for the system.</p>
<p>Detail refers to the low-level implementation details that are required to implement the policy decisions. These include things like the specific algorithms, data structures, and code that make up the system’s components. Details are often implemented by developers and are responsible for the actual functioning of the system.</p>
