<p>Composition over inheritance is a programming principle that suggests that it is better to use composition, a mechanism for assembling objects, to create complex objects, rather than using inheritance, which is a mechanism for creating new classes based on existing ones.</p>
<p>Inheritance is a powerful mechanism for creating reusable code, but it can also lead to tightly coupled, hard-to-maintain code. This is because inherited classes are tightly bound to their parent classes and any changes made to the parent class will affect all of its child classes. This makes it hard to change or extend the code without affecting the entire class hierarchy.</p>
