<p>YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It) is a software development principle that suggests that developers should not add functionality to a codebase unless it is immediately necessary. The idea is to avoid creating unnecessary complexity in the codebase by only adding features that are actually needed.</p>
<p>The YAGNI principle is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which are part of the SOLID principles. YAGNI aims to keep the codebase as simple as possible by avoiding the creation of unnecessary abstractions and functionality.</p>
