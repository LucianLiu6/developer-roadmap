<p>Programming against abstractions is a programming principle that suggests that code should be written in such a way that it is not tied to specific implementations, but rather to abstractions. This is accomplished by defining interfaces or abstract classes that define the behavior of a group of related classes without specifying their implementation.</p>
<p>Programming against abstractions allows for more flexibility in the code. When changes are needed, they can be made to the implementation of the abstractions without affecting the code that uses them. This makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain the code.</p>
