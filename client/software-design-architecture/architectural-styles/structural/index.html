<p>Structural architecture in software refers to the organization and design of the components of a software system, and how they interact with each other. It deals with the physical organization of the system, and the relationships between the different components.</p>
<p>There are several different structural architecture patterns and styles that can be used to design software systems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monolithic: where the system is built as a single, integrated, and self-contained unit.</li>
<li>Layered: where the system is divided into a set of layers, each of which has a specific responsibility and communicates with the other layers through well-defined interfaces.</li>
<li>Microservices: where the system is built as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services.</li>
<li>Event-driven: where the system reacts to specific events that occur, rather than being continuously polled for changes.</li>
<li>Client-Server: where a client sends requests to a server, and the server responds to those requests</li>
<li>Peer-to-Peer: where each node in the network acts as both a client and a server</li>
<li>Component-based: where the system is composed of reusable and independent software components</li>
<li>Domain-Driven: where the system is organized around the core business domain and business entities.</li>
</ul>
