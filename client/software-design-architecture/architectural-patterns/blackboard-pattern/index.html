<p>The Blackboard architectural pattern is a software design pattern that allows for the creation of a centralized repository of information that can be accessed and modified by multiple independent modules or subsystems. The blackboard serves as a communication and coordination mechanism between these modules, allowing them to share information and collaborate to achieve a common goal. This pattern is often used in artificial intelligence and decision-making systems, where multiple processes or agents need to share and reason over complex data.</p>
