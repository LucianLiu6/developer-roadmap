<p>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an architectural pattern that is used to design software systems based on the core business domain and business entities, it’s focused on creating a clear and accurate representation of the business domain within the software system, and on aligning the software system with the business goals and objectives. DDD provides several advantages over other architectural patterns, such as alignment with business goals and objectives, improved communication between domain experts and developers, a clear and expressive model of the business domain and improved scalability and maintainability. It’s implemented using a set of principles and patterns such as strategic design, subdomains, bounded context, entities, value objects, aggregate, and repository.</p>
