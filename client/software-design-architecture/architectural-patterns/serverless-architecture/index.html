<p>Serverless architecture is a design pattern that allows developers to build and run applications and services without having to provision and manage servers. Instead, these applications and services are executed in a fully managed environment, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions, where the infrastructure and scaling are handled automatically by the cloud provider.</p>
<p>This architecture pattern mainly focuses on the business logic and event-driven execution, rather than on server management. It allows developers to write and deploy code in small, single-purpose functions that are triggered by specific events, such as changes in a database or the arrival of new data in a stream.</p>
