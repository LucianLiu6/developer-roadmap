<p><code>Content Aging</code> refers to the natural process where the information or data presented becomes outdated or irrelevant over time. This typically happens in rapidly evolving industries or topics, where new developments or advancements regularly occur. As a technical writer, itâ€™s crucial to regularly review and update your content to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Ignored, aged content can lead to misinformation, confusion, and loss of trust among your readers. Therefore, a systematic approach to manage content aging, like implementing a review cycle or updating schedule, is an integral part of content management strategy.</p>
