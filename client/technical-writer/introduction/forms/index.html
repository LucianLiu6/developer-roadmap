<p>These can range from user manuals, how-to guides, white papers, design specifications, and project plans, among others. Each form serves a different purpose and audience. For instance, user manuals are typically directed towards end users, providing step-by-step instructions on how to use a particular product. On the other hand, design specifications target developers or technical teams, detailing how a certain technology or product should be designed or built. These various forms highlight the breadth and diversity of output that a technical writer can create. Itâ€™s essential for a technical writer to understand the distinctions and appropriate usage of these forms to effectively communicate technical information.</p>
