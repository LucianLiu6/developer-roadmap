<p>”Mid Funnel” refers to the phase in the marketing funnel where the consumer has moved beyond initial awareness and is now considering various options. At this stage, potential buyers are evaluating the information and comparing solutions. It is the job of a technical writer to provide content, such as case studies, webinars, whitepapers, demonstrative videos, etc., that helps guide the consumer towards choosing their solution. Technical writers must provide accurate information, uphold the brand’s integrity, and position the product or service as a solution that meets the potential customer’s needs effectively.</p>
