<p><code>Keyword volume</code>, also referred to as <code>search volume</code> or <code>keyword search volume</code>, is a metric that reflects the number of times a specific keyword was searched for in a search engine (like Google) within a specified timeframe. This data is typically monthly but can be analyzed over different time periods. A higher keyword volume means that more people are searching for that particular term. SEO tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs can be used to find the volume of keywords. Note that keyword volume doesnâ€™t assess the quality of a keyword, it only measures popularity.</p>
