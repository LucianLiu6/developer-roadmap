<p>The <strong>Buyer Journey</strong> refers to the process a customer goes through from the moment they become aware of a need or desire until the point of purchase. It is often categorized into three main stages: Awareness, Consideration, and Decision. In the <em>Awareness</em> stage, the customer realizes they have a problem or need. During the <em>Consideration</em> stage, they evaluate different options to satisfy that need. Finally, in the <em>Decision</em> stage, they choose a specific solution. Understanding the buyer journey is instrumental for businesses, as it helps them tailor their marketing strategies to the right audience at the right time.</p>
