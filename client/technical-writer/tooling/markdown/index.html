<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It was created by John Gruber, with significant contributions from Aaron Swartz, with the goal of allowing people “to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format”. Key features include automatic production of well-structured, ready-to-publish documents from ‘readable’ text files. Its syntax includes items like headers (<code># Header</code>), bullet lists (<code>- item</code>), italics (<code>*text*</code>), bold (<code>**text**</code>), links (<code>[description](url)</code>) and so forth. Markdown files usually end with <code>.md</code> or <code>.markdown</code>.</p>
