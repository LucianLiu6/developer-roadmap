<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> refers to the act of copying someone elseâ€™s work, ideas, or expressions and presenting them as your own without giving due credit to the original author. This unoriginal practice is seen as theft of intellectual property and can incur serious repercussions in both academic and professional settings. In the case of technical writing, using specialized plagiarism detection softwares is crucial to ensure the originality and authenticity of the content. Some of these detection tools include Turnitin, Grammarly, Copyscape, and many more. They work by cross-referencing your work with a vast database of academic and professional documents to identify any matching phrases that could constitute plagiarism.</p>
