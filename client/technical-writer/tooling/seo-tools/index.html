<p>SEO tools are critical for any technical writer as they help streamline the process of optimizing content for search engines. There is a wide variety of these tools available in the market, some of the most popular ones being Google Analytics, SEMRush, Moz, and Ahrefs. These tools provide different functionalities such as keyword research, backlink analysis, and website audits. They can work as stand-alone tools or be integrated within content management systems for seamless functioning.
