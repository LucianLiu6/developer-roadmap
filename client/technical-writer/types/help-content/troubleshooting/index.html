<p>Troubleshooting is a vital aspect of help content where the technical writer provides solutions to potential problems end-users might encounter while using a product or a service. Typically formatted as a step-by-step guide, troubleshooting guides arenâ€™t necessarily there to fix the issue immediately but to identify what course of action to take in case of certain problems. Clear, precise, and easy-to-follow, these guides should cover common software issues, hardware malfunctions, or system errors, significantly improving user experience and reducing the need for support service contacts.</p>
