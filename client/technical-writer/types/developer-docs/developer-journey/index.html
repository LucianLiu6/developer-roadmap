<h2 id="developer-journey-1">Developer Journey</h2>
<p>The term “developer journey” usually refers to the full spectrum of experiences a developer goes through - from learning about a system or tool for the first time, to getting set up, to building or integrating applications with it. This journey typically involves a series of phases including initial discovery, setup and installation, first use, ongoing development, troubleshooting and optimisation. Developer docs play an integral role in this journey, providing necessary instruction and guidance at each step. Recognising key stages in the developer journey can help guide the design and organisation of developer docs, ensuring they deliver pertinent, useful content that enhances the overall developer experience.</p>
