<p>The <strong>documentation structure</strong> refers to the arrangement and organization of information within the documentation. It should offer an intuitive and logical user navigation to facilitate quick comprehension and locate vital information effortlessly. The structure usually includes sections such as <strong>Overview</strong>, explaining the product and its issues it solves. <strong>Getting Started</strong> or <strong>Quick Start Guide</strong> offers initial information about using a product right away. <strong>Tutorials</strong> provide a step-by-step guide to completing a particular task. <strong>How-to guides</strong> solve a problem or accomplish specific user goals. <strong>Concept guides</strong> offer deeper understanding about the product’s functionality while <strong>API/SDK Documentation</strong> contains code-based information. Lastly, <strong>Reference Manuals</strong> or <strong>User guides</strong> provide comprehensive details of the product’s functionality. The structure may vary depending on the type of product/service.</p>
