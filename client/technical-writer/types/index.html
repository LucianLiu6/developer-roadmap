<p>There are several types of technical writing, each focused on different aspects. <strong>End-user documentation writers</strong> specialize in creating materials for product users (like user manuals and quick start guides). <strong>Traditional technical writers</strong> draft articles, FAQs, guides, and other content primarily for websites. <strong>API/SDK writers</strong> are responsible for creating and maintaining documentation for application programming interfaces (Software Development Kits), which requires knowledge of multiple programming languages. <strong>Medical writers</strong> work in the medical sector and must understand medical concepts. <strong>Grant and proposal writers</strong> are essential for organizations obtaining funds for projects. Note that these are not all mutually exclusive; many technical writers span multiple categories.</p>
