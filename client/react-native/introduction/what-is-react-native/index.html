<p>React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, which significantly speeds up development without compromising on the performance and usability of the apps.</p>
<p>With React Native, you write components with JSX, a syntax that combines JavaScript and XML. These components can map to native UI elements like views, text, images, and more.</p>
