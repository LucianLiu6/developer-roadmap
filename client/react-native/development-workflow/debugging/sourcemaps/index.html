<p>Sourcemaps are files that map the original source code of a project to its minified or transpiled version. This is especially useful in environments, like React Native, where the code may be transformed before being executed in the device/emulator. Sourcemaps help developers to debug their code more easily by mapping errors in the transformed code back to their original location in the source code.</p>
<p>There are various types of sourcemaps which give different levels of detail to the debugging process:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>eval</code>: Uses <code>eval</code> function to generate the sourcemaps. This is faster but provides less detailed information than other options.</li>
<li><code>cheap-source-map</code>: Simple line-to-line mapping without column information. Faster than <code>source-map</code> but less accurate.</li>
<li><code>cheap-module-source-map</code>: Similar to <code>cheap-source-map</code> but with support for modules.</li>
<li><code>source-map</code>: Full source mapping with both line and column information. It is accurate, though slower compared to other options.</li>
</ul>
<p>After generating sourcemaps, you can use them to debug errors more efficiently, as they will reference the original locations in the source code. The browserâ€™s developer tools, like Google Chrome, have built-in support for sourcemaps, providing the ability to navigate and debug errors with ease.</p>
