<p>In React Native, setting up the development environment is a crucial step. The environment setup process includes installing and configuring various tools and packages required for developing, building, and launching a React Native application. There are two main approaches when setting up your React Native development environment:</p>

<p>Expo CLI is a command-line tool built for creating and managing React Native projects easily. It streamlines your development process by providing an entire development environment, including building and deploying your app to both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
