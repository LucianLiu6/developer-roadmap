<p>Push notifications are a way to engage and retain users by delivering alerts, messages, or other information directly to their devices, even when the app is not running. They are an essential feature in modern mobile applications as they help keep users informed about important updates and allow developers to encourage user interaction with the app.</p>
<p>In React Native, you can implement push notifications using third-party libraries or services. Some popular options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for both Android and iOS</li>
<li>Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for iOS</li>
</ul>
