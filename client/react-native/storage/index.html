<p>React Native provides a few ways to persist data locally in the app. Here’s a brief summary of the storage options available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Async Storage</li>
<li>Expo Secure Store</li>
<li>Expo File System</li>
<li>Expo SQLite</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the storage option that best fits your app’s requirements and use cases. Keep in mind that AsyncStorage and SecureStorage are more suited for small-scale data storage, while Realm and SQLite support more complex storage and querying needs.</p>
