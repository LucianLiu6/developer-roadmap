<p>Appium is an open-source test automation framework for mobile devices, targeting native, hybrid, or mobile-web apps for iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. Appium works with multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, and C#.</p>
<p>Appium uses the WebDriver protocol, which allows you to write tests that can interact with your app through a series of commands. The WebDriver protocol interprets these commands into actions that are then performed on the app.</p>
