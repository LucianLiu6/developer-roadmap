<p>The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.</p>
<p>Angular uses the Observer pattern which simply means â€” Observable objects are registered, and other objects observe (in Angular using the subscribe method) them and take action when the observable object is acted on in some way.</p>
