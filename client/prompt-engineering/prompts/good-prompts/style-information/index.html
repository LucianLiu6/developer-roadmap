<p>By providing explicit instructions regarding the desired tone, you can influence the language model’s writing style and ensure it aligns with your specific requirements.</p>
<p>Clearly communicate the desired tone, style, or mood in the prompt. Whether it’s formal, casual, humorous, professional, or any other specific style, mentioning it explicitly helps guide the model’s writing. Also, consider ncorporating keywords or phrases that reflect the desired style. For example, if you want a formal tone, include phrases like “in a professional manner” or “using formal language.” This provides additional context to the model regarding the tone you expect.</p>

<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Write a formal email to decline a job offer.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this prompt example, the instruction explicitly states the desired tone as “formal.” The model understands that the response should reflect a professional and formal writing style appropriate for declining a job offer.</p>
