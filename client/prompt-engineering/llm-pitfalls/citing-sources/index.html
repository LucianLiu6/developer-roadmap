<p>LLMs for the most part cannot accurately cite sources. This is because they do not have access to the Internet, and do not exactly remember where their information came from. They will frequently generate sources that look good, but are entirely inaccurate.</p>
<p>Strategies like search augmented LLMs (LLMs that can search the Internet and other sources) can often fix this problem though.</p>
