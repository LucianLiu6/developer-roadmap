<p>LLMs will frequently generate falsehoods when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. Sometimes they will state that they do not know the answer, but much of the time they will confidently give a wrong answer.</p>
<h3 id="causes-of-hallucinations">Causes of Hallucinations</h3>
<p>There are several factors contributing to hallucinations in LMs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Inherent limitations</strong>: The training data for the LMs are massive, yet they still cannot contain the entire knowledge about the world. As a result, LMs have inherent limitations in handling certain facts or details, which leads to hallucinations in the generated text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training data biases</strong>: If the training data contains biases or errors, it may lead to hallucinations in the output as LMs learn from the data they’ve been exposed to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Token-based scoring</strong>: The default behavior of many LMs, like GPT models, is to generate text based on token probabilities. Sometimes this can lead to high-probability tokens being selected even if it doesn’t make sense with the given prompt.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mitigating-hallucinations">Mitigating Hallucinations</h3>
<p>To reduce the occurrence of hallucinations in the generated text, consider the following strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Specify instructions</strong>: Make the prompt more explicit with clear details and constraints. This can help guide the model to generate more accurate and coherent responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step-by-step approach</strong>: Instead of asking the model to generate a complete response in one go, break down the task into smaller steps and iteratively generate the output. This can help in maintaining better control over the generated content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model adjustments</strong>: Tweak various parameters, such as <code>temperature</code> or <code>top_p</code>, to adjust the randomness and control of the generated text. Lower values will make the output more conservative, which can help reduce hallucinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validating and filtering</strong>: Develop post-processing steps to validate and filter the generated text based on specific criteria or rules to minimize the prevalence of hallucinations in the output.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that even with these strategies, it’s impossible to completely eliminate hallucinations. However, being aware of their existence and employing methods to mitigate them can significantly improve the quality and reliability of LM-generated content.</p>
