<p>Prompting is the process of giving a model a “prompt” or instruction for the task that you want it to perform. For example, if you have some English text that you may want to translate to French, you could give the following prompt:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Translate the text delimited by triple quotes from English to French: </span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>"""Hello, how are you?"""</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>The model will then generate the following output:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Bonjour, comment allez-vous?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, we gave the model a prompt with instructions to perform a task. If you notice, we followed a special way to write our prompt. We could simply give it the following prompt and it would have still worked:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Translate the following to French:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Hello, how are you?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>But it’s one of the best practices to be clear and use delimiters to separate the content in prompt from the instructions. You will learn more about it in the “Best Practices” nodes of the roadmap.</p>
