<p>All you need to instruct model to perform a task is a prompt. A prompt is a piece of text that you give to the model to perform a task.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to summarize an article, you could simply write the prompt with the article text on the top and the prompt:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Long article text here .............</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>....................................</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Summarize the above article for me.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to translate a sentence from English to French, you could simply write the prompt with the English sentence on the top and the prompt:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>This is a sentence in English.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Translate the above sentence to French.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to generate a new text, you could simply write the prompt with the instructions and the model will give you the text.</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Write me an introductory guide about Prompt Engineering.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>However, using plain text as prompts i.e. without using any best practices you may not be able to fully utilise the power of LLMs. That’s where “Prompt Engineering” or knowing the best practices for writing better prompts and getting the most out of LLMs comes in.</p>
