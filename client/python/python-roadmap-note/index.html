<p>This roadmap specifically covers <strong>Python and the ecosystem</strong> around it. You will notice that it is missing things like version control, databases, software design, architecture and other things that are not directly related to Python; this is intentional. Have a look at the <a href="/backend">Backend Roadmap</a> for a more comprehensive overview of the backend ecosystem.</p>
