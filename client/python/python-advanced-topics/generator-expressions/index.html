<p>Generator expressions are a concise way to create a generator using a single line of code in Python. They are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list, they create a generator object that produces the values on-demand, as they are needed.</p>
<p>Generator expressions are a useful tool for efficiently producing large sequence of values, as they allow you to create the generator without creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This tends to use less memory, especially for large sequences.</p>
