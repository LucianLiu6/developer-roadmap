<p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are an integral part of modern development, allowing software applications to communicate and use functions from other software applications or services. API design, therefore, becomes a key part of any software development process. Furthermore, the basics of API design encompass understanding the principles of what an API is, how it works, and the various types of APIs, such as REST, SOAP, and GraphQL. This also includes understanding the standards and best practices in API design to ensure the development of powerful, user-friendly, and secure APIs. The foundation of API Design lies in this knowledge, setting the stage for more complex API designing and development.</p>
