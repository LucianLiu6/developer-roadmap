<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an essential standard in API Design that addresses the storage, transfer, and processing of personal data of individuals within the European Union. With regards to API Design, considerations must be given on how APIs handle, process, and secure the data to conform with GDPR’s demands on data privacy and security. This includes requirements for explicit consent, right to erasure, data portability, and privacy by design. Non-compliance with these standards not only leads to hefty fines but may also erode trust from users and clients. As such, understanding the impact and integration of GDPR within API design is pivotal for organizations handling EU residents’ data.</p>
