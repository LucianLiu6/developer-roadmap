<p>Stoplight is an advanced tool that offers a comprehensive platform for technical teams to handle all aspects of API design. Leveraging Stoplight, teams can design, document and develop APIs in a more collaborative and streamlined manner. It uses an OpenAPI specification and allows users to design APIs visually, making API development easier. With its ability to auto-generate API documentation, performing API mock testing, and providing API management features, Stoplight plays a crucial role in adopting a design-first approach in API development. By using Stoplight, APIs can be designed to be easy-to-use, scalable, and robust from the outset, which ultimately improves the overall development process and quality of the APIs.</p>
