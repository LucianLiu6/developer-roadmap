<p>GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. Unlike REST, where you have predefined data return structures for each endpoint, GraphQL APIs are designed around a type system and enable the client application to precisely specify what data it needs from the server. This gives a lot of flexibility and efficiency, leading to fewer round trips to the server and significantly enhancing the performance of the client application. Whether you are building a small project or an enterprise-scale application, understanding and implementing GraphQL APIs can result in cleaner, more manageable code.</p>
