<p>API keys and management is an integral part of API design. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API. This ensures security and control over API endpoints, as only those with a valid API key can make requests. API Management, on the other hand, refers to the practices and tools that enable an organization to govern and monitor its API usage. It involves all the aspects of managing APIs including design, deployment, documentation, security, versioning, and analytics. Both elements play crucial roles in securing and organizing API access for efficient and controlled data sharing and communication.</p>
