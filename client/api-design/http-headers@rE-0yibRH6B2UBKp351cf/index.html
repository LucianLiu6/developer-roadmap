<p>HTTP Headers play a crucial role in API Design as they provide essential information between the client and server regarding the data to be exchanged. Headers are part of the HTTP request and response message, with types including Standard, Non-standard, Common or Uncommon headers. They can define parameters such as content type, authentication, response status, cookies, and more. Understanding and effectively utilizing HTTP Headers is key to designing robust and secure APIs. A well-defined set of headers ensures successful data exchange, handles errors gracefully, and improves overall communication between the client and server.</p>
