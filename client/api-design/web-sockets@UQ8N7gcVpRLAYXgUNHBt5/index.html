<p>Web Sockets provide a long-lived connection between a client and a server over which messages can be sent bi-directionally, in real-time. They play a crucial role in creating real-time APIs by offering a faster and more efficient communication method over the traditional HTTP. In the context of API Design, Web Sockets are used for developing APIs that require real-time data transfer, such as chat applications, live sports updates, and real-time analytics. This paradigm shift from traditional HTTP-based API design to Web Socket-based API design helps create APIs that are more responsive, dynamic, and efficient in handling real-time data.</p>
