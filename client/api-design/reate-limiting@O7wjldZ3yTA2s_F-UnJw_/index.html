<p>Rate Limiting is a critical aspect of API Design that dictates the number of API calls a client can make within a specified timeframe. This helps in managing resource allocation, preventing abuse of the API, and maintaining the overall health of the API system. Proper rate limiting measures should be in place to ensure the API’s stability, thereby delivering a consistent and reliable service to all consumers. It works primarily by setting a limit on the frequency of client requests, thereby preventing individual users from overloading the system. It is crucial to design and implement rate limiting carefully for maintaining API availability and performance.</p>
