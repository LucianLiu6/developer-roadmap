<p>Server-Sent Events (SSE) represent an explicit concept in the design of Real-time APIs. Unlike traditional approaches where a client sends a request and awaits a response from the server, SSE enables a server to push data to clients whenever a particular event takes place. SSE is especially fundamental in API design when it comes to the development of applications where real-time data is essential, such as live news updates, real-time gaming, or live-streaming services. Designing APIs with the SSE approach ensures a more dynamic and responsive user experience.</p>
