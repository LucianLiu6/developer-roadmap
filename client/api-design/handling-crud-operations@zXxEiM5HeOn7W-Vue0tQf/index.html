<p>When designing APIs, one needs to account for various types of interactions with data - these typically revolve around the CRUD operations; Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Whether the API is designed for a banking app or a social media platform, the need to create new data, read or retrieve existing data, update or modify that data, and delete unnecessary data is universal.</p>
<p>Therefore, mastering CRUD operations in API design is a fundamental skill. Effective handling of CRUD operations facilitates seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end systems, and ensures proper data management, thereby improving user experience.</p>
