<p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a critical concept in API Design. It is a mechanism that uses HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. By default, web browsers prohibit web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one the web page came from. CORS is the guideline that lets you configure a set of rules on the server to define which types of cross-domain requests are allowed, providing much-needed flexibility without compromising security. Understanding CORS is crucial in designing APIs that ensure safe and effective inter-domain communication.</p>
