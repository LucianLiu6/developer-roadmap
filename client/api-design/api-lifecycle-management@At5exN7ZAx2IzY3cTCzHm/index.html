<p>API Lifecycle Management is a crucial aspect in API design that oversees the process of creating, managing, and retiring APIs. This involves various stages from initial planning, designing, testing, deployment, to eventual retirement of the API. Proper lifecycle management ensures that an API meets the requirements, is reliable, and that it evolves with the needs of end users and developers. Moreover, it helps in maintaining the security, performance, and accessibility of the API throughout its lifetime. This comprehensive approach enables organizations to make the most of their APIs, mitigate issues, and facilitate successful digital transformation.</p>
