<p>API Integration Patterns, in the context of API Design, refers to the common paradigms and approaches used to enable communication between services. These patterns dictate how different APIs interact and exchange data, allowing software applications to work cohesively. They play a vital role in application development by providing a standard method for connecting diverse software components. By understanding and implementing these patterns, developers can design more robust, scalable, and interoperable APIs.</p>
