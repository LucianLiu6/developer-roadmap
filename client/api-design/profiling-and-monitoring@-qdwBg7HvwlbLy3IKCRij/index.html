<p>Profiling and monitoring are critical aspects of API design and implementation. Profiling, in this context, refers to the process of analyzing the behavior of your API in order to understand various performance metrics including response times, request rates, error rates, and the overall health and functionality of your API. On the other hand, monitoring is the ongoing process of checking the status of your API to ensure itâ€™s functioning as expected while also providing an early warning system for potential issues and improvements. Together, profiling and monitoring your API can lead to a more reliable, efficient, and high-performing service.</p>
