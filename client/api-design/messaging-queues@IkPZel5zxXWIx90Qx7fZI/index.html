<p>Messaging Queues play a fundamental role in API design, particularly in creating robust, decoupled, and efficient systems. These queues act like a buffer, storing messages or data sent from a sender (producer), allowing a receiver (consumer) to retrieve and process them at its own pace. In the context of API design, this concept enables developers to handle high-volume data processing requirements, providing an asynchronous communication protocol between multiple services. The benefits of messaging queues in API design include better system scalability, fault tolerance, and increased overall system resiliency.</p>
