<p>API Versioning is a critical component of API Design and Management. As the APIs evolve over time to meet the new business requirements and functionality enhancements, it is crucial to manage the changes in a way that doesnâ€™t break the existing client applications. This calls for effective versioning strategies in API design. There are different versioning strategies like URI versioning, Request Header versioning, and Media Type versioning which are adopted based on the ease of implementation, client compatibility, and accessibility. Understanding each strategy and its pros and cons can lead to better API Design and maintainability.</p>
