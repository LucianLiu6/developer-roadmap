<p>Swagger, also known as OpenAPI, is a set of tools specifically used for designing, building, and documenting RESTful Web services. API developers heavily rely on it due to its incredible feature for designing APIs with a clear and easy-to-understand approach. By utilizing the OpenAPI Specification (OAS), developers can accurately define a RESTful API that can easily be used across various programming languages. This powerful universal language is a key component for effective and efficient API design.</p>
