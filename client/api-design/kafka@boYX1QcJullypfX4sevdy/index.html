<p>Apache Kafka is a real-time, fault-tolerant, and highly reliable messaging system that’s integral to API design. It’s primarily used to build real-time data streaming applications and microservices due to its inherent ability to handle high volume data and multi-subscriber support. In the context of API design, Kafka provides a robust messaging queue system that enables cloud-based platforms and services to communicate seamlessly with each other in a real-time environment. Moreover, the API designers use Kafka APIs such as Producer API, Consumer API, Streams API, and Connect API which enable the transmission and manipulation of messages within the Kafka ecosystem.</p>
