<p>When creating effective API designs, addressing Error Handling and Retries forms an essential facet. This is primarily due to the fact that APIs arenâ€™t always error-free and instances of network hiccups or input inaccuracies from users can occur. Without robust error handling, such occurrences can easily lead to catastrophic application failure or unsatisfactory user experiences.</p>
<p>In this context, error handling can refer to validating inputs, managing exceptions, and returning appropriate error message or status codes to the user. Meanwhile, the concept of retries comes into play to ensure maximum request success amidst transient failures. Through correctly implemented retries, an API can repeatedly attempt to execute a request until it is successful, thus ensuring seamless operation. The criteria and mechanisms of retries, including the count, delay, and conditions for retries, are crucial aspects to solidify during the API design.</p>
