<p><strong>Data Lineage</strong> refers to the life-cycle of data, including its origins, movements, characteristics and quality. Itâ€™s a critical component in MLOps for tracking the journey of data through every process in a pipeline, from raw input to model output. Data lineage helps in maintaining transparency, ensuring compliance, and facilitating data debugging or tracing data related bugs. It provides a clear representation of data sources, transformations, and dependencies thereby aiding in audits, governance, or reproduction of machine learning models.</p>
<p>Feature stores are a crucial component of MLOps infrastructure.</p>
