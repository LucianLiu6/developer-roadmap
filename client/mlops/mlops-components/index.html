<p>MLOps components can be broadly classified into three major categories: Development, Operations and Governance. The <strong>Development</strong> components include everything involved in the creation of machine learning models, such as data extraction, data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model training. The <strong>Operations</strong> category includes components involved in deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production. This may include release management, model serving, and performance monitoring. Lastly, the <strong>Governance</strong> category encompasses the policies and regulations related to machine learning models. This includes model audit and tracking, model explainability, and security &#x26; compliance regulations.</p>
