<p><strong>Monitoring</strong> in MLOps primarily involves tracking the performance of machine learning (ML) models in production to ensure that they continually deliver accurate and reliable results. Such monitoring is necessary because the real-world data that these models handle may change over time, a scenario known as data drift. These changes can adversely affect model performance. Monitoring helps to detect any anomalies in the modelâ€™s behaviour or performance and such alerts can trigger the retraining of models with new data. From a broader perspective, monitoring also involves tracking resources and workflows to detect and rectify any operational issues in the MLOps pipeline.</p>
