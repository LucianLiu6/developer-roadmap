<p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its significant use of indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a “batteries included” language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
