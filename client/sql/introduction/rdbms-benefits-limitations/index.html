<p>Here are some of the benefits of using an RDBMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Structured Data</strong>: RDBMS allows data storage in a structured way, using rows and columns in tables. This makes it easy to manipulate the data using SQL (Structured Query Language), ensuring efficient and flexible usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACID Properties</strong>: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure reliable and safe data manipulation in a RDBMS, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong>: RDBMS supports data normalization, a process that organizes data in a way that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: RDBMSs generally provide good scalability options, allowing for the addition of more storage or computational resources as the data and workload grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Integrity</strong>: RDBMS provides mechanisms like constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys to enforce data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: RDBMSs offer various security features such as user authentication, access control, and data encryption to protect sensitive data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the limitations of using an RDBMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Complexity</strong>: Setting up and managing an RDBMS can be complex, especially for large applications. It requires technical knowledge and skills to manage, tune, and optimize the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: RDBMSs can be expensive, both in terms of licensing fees and the computational and storage resources they require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixed Schema</strong>: RDBMS follows a rigid schema for data organization, which means any changes to the schema can be time-consuming and complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling of Unstructured Data</strong>: RDBMSs are not suitable for handling unstructured data like multimedia files, social media posts, and sensor data, as their relational structure is optimized for structured data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Horizontal Scalability</strong>: RDBMSs are not as easily horizontally scalable as NoSQL databases. Scaling horizontally, which involves adding more machines to the system, can be challenging in terms of cost and complexity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
