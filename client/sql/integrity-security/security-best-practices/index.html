<p>Database security is key in ensuring sensitive information is kept intact and isnâ€™t exposed to a malicious or accidental breach. Here are some best practices related to SQL security:</p>
<h2 id="1-least-privilege-principle">1. Least Privilege Principle</h2>
<p>This principle states that a user should have the minimum levels of access necessary and nothing more. For large systems, this could require a good deal of planning.</p>
<h2 id="2-regular-updates">2. Regular Updates</h2>
<p>Always keep SQL Server patched and updated to gain the benefit of the most recent security updates.</p>
<h2 id="3-complex-and-secure-passwords">3. Complex and Secure Passwords</h2>
<p>Passwords should be complex and frequently changed. Alongside the use of <code>GRANT</code> and <code>REVOKE</code>, this is the front line of defense.</p>
<h2 id="4-limiting-remote-access">4. Limiting Remote Access</h2>
<p>If remote connections to the SQL server are not necessary, it is best to disable it.</p>
<h2 id="5-avoid-using-sql-server-admin-account">5. Avoid Using SQL Server Admin Account</h2>
<p>You should avoid using the SQL Server admin account for regular database operations to limit security risk.</p>
<h2 id="6-encrypt-communication">6. Encrypt Communication</h2>
<p>To protect against data sniffing, all communication between SQL Server and applications should be encrypted.</p>
<h2 id="7-database-backups">7. Database Backups</h2>
<p>Regular database backups are crucial for data integrity if there happens to be a data loss.</p>
<h2 id="8-monitoring-and-auditing">8. Monitoring and Auditing</h2>
<p>Regularly monitor and audit your database operations to keep track of who does what in your database.</p>
<h2 id="9-regular-vulnerability-scanning">9. Regular Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
<p>Use a vulnerability scanner to assess the security posture of your SQL.</p>
<h2 id="10-sql-injection">10. SQL Injection</h2>
<p>SQL injection can be reduced by using parameterized queries or prepared statements.</p>
<p>These practices can significantly improve your SQL security posture. However, remember that security is not a one-time effort, but a continuous process. Regular assessment and necessary updates are key.  Remember to keep an eye on security news concerning SQL Server and regularly check for new security risks or vulnerabilities.</p>
