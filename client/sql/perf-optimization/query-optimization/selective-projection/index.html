<p>Selective projection in SQL is a concept related to retrieving only specific columns from a table rather than retrieving all columns. It’s one of the most basic ways to optimize your queries in SQL and make them more efficient.</p>
<p>In SQL, a projection refers to the operation in which we choose certain columns (instead of all columns) from the table for our query results. If a table has numerous columns, and we only need data from a few of them, it’s more efficient to only select those specific columns in the SQL query. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned and fetched from the database, thereby improving performance.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Let’s take an example where you have a “students” table with the following columns: Id, Name, Age, Gender, Department, and City. If you only need Name and Department information, you should use a selective projection to specify only these columns in your SELECT statement:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">SELECT</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> Name</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, Department </span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">FROM</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> students</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This query returns just the Name and Department columns, rather than all fields in the students table.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you used a <code>SELECT *</code> statement:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">SELECT</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> *</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> </span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">FROM</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> students</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This would return all columns from the “students” table which can be inefficient if you don’t need all that data.</p>
<p>Selective projection can greatly optimize your SQL queries by minimizing the amount of data handled. It’s especially beneficial when tables have large amounts of data and many columns, but only a subset of information is required.</p>
