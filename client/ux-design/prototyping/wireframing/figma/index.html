<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong>: Figma lets multiple users work on a single design simultaneously, so teams can easily collaborate and see each other’s changes in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform-independent</strong>: As a web-based tool, Figma is accessible from any device with a browser and an internet connection. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Components</strong>: Figma uses a ‘component’ system, which allows you to reuse elements across your designs. By creating a master component, any updates made to the master will be reflected in all instances, helping to keep your designs consistent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prototyping</strong>: Figma allows you to create interactive prototypes of your designs using built-in prototyping features, including animations and transitions. This helps you to communicate the intended user experience to stakeholders and to test your designs with users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Version history</strong>: Figma automatically saves your work and maintains a version history that lets you go back to any previous version of your design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plugins</strong>: Figma supports a wide range of user-created plugins that extend its functionality, allowing you to tailor the tool to your specific needs.</p>
