<p>Making progress visible is an essential part of UX design, as it helps users understand where they are in a process, and it gives them a sense of control and achievement. In this section, we’ll discuss the importance of making progress visible and provide some practical tips for incorporating this approach into your designs.</p>

<p>Visible progress can significantly impact user experience. It helps in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reducing user anxiety</strong>: When users can see that they’re making progress, they experience less anxiety and frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Building engagement</strong>: Progress indicators help users feel invested and engaged with a task or product.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding drop-offs</strong>: When users can see the end of a process, they’re more likely to complete it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Incorporate these best practices into your UX design to make progress visible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use progress bars:</strong> A simple and effective way to show progress is through progress bars. You can use them for linear processes, like form completion or steps in a tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>Break tasks into manageable steps:</strong> Chunking tasks into smaller steps makes them more manageable for users, and it allows users to see progress as they complete each step.</li>
<li><strong>Give feedback on progress:</strong> Provide clear feedback on the user’s progress, such as a tick or checkmark, accompanying text, or a change of color.</li>
<li><strong>Estimate time or effort:</strong> Give users a sense of how long a task will take, or how much effort is involved, by showing time estimates or the number of steps involved.</li>
<li><strong>Enable users to review progress:</strong> Allow users to review their progress and easily navigate between completed steps if they need to make changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>By making progress visible, you can provide users with a sense of accomplishment, reduce anxiety, and encourage engagement with your product. Keep this approach in mind during your UX design process to create more satisfying and user-friendly experiences.</p>
