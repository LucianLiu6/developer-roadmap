<p>Temporal myopia, also known as short-termism, occurs when individuals or organizations prioritize immediate gains over long-term benefits. This focus on the present can lead to suboptimal decisions, negatively impacting the overall user experience (UX) in the long run. As a UX designer, your goal is to avoid temporal myopia and create designs keeping the long-term user experience in mind.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-vs-short-term-ux">Long-term vs. Short-term UX</h2>
