<p>Sometimes, users need a gentle reminder of the commitments or decisions they’ve made in the past to help them move forward in their user journey. As a UX designer, you can incorporate these reminders to create a sense of urgency and promote desired actions from users.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-reminding-users-of-prior-commitments">Benefits of Reminding Users of Prior Commitments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivate users to act</strong>: When reminded of a commitment they’ve already made, users are more likely to follow through with the action, especially if they feel they’ve invested time or resources toward that action.</li>
<li><strong>Create a sense of urgency</strong>: By emphasizing the importance of their commitments, users are more likely to prioritize their tasks and act sooner.</li>
<li><strong>Promote consistency</strong>: Reminding users of their prior commitments can promote consistency in their behavior and decision-making, leading to a better user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategies-to-remind-users-of-prior-commitments">Strategies to Remind Users of Prior Commitments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display progress indicators</strong>: Show users how far they have come in a process, such as filling out a form or completing a survey, to remind them of their progress so far.</li>
<li><strong>Use notifications</strong>: Send timely notifications or reminders to remind users of their prior commitments, such as appointments they made or tasks they wished to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage personalized content</strong>: Customize content to emphasize a user’s previous actions, for example, by showing related products based on prior purchases, or pre-filling forms with previously entered data.</li>
<li><strong>Create social proof</strong>: Showcase testimonials, reviews, or follower counts to remind users of their decision to join a community or use a product, creating a sense of belonging and reinforcing their initial commitment.</li>
</ul>
<p>By incorporating reminders of prior commitments in the user experience, you can make users feel more invested in the process, create a sense of urgency, and ultimately, improve the overall UX design.</p>
