<p>Priming user relevant associations is a vital concept in UX design, aiming to create positive associations with various aspects of the user’s experience. To achieve this, designers must tap into the cognitive aspects influencing a user’s perception, decision-making, and overall satisfaction with the product or service.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-user-relevance">Understanding User Relevance</h2>
<p>To prime user-relevant associations, it’s essential to first understand the users and their expectations. Conduct user research to identify their motivations, preferences, and context of use. This helps in shaping the product’s design and creating experiences that resonate with their specific needs and desires.</p>

<p>Foster meaningful experiences to evoke positive emotions and establish strong resonating associations. This can be done through:</p>
