<p>SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) is a family of cryptographic hash functions created by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The family includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>SHA-0: Published in 1993, this is the first algorithm in the family. Shortly after its release, it was discontinued for an undisclosed significant flaw.</li>
<li>SHA-1: Created to replace SHA-0 and which resembles MD5, this algorithm has been considered insecure since 2010.</li>
<li>SHA-2: This isn’t an algorithm, but a set of them, with SHA-256 and SHA-512 being the most popular. SHA-2 is still secure and widely used.</li>
<li>SHA-3: Born in a competition, this is the newest member of the family. SHA-3 is very secure and doesn’t carry the same design flaws as its brethren.</li>
</ul>
