<p>Test driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests for softwareâ€™s requirements which will fail until the software is developed to meet those requirements. Once those tests pass, then the cycle repeats to refactor code or develop another feature/requirement. In theory, this ensures that software is written to meet requirements in the simplest form, and avoids code defects.</p>
