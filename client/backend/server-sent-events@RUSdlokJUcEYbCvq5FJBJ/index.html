<p>Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that allows a web server to push data to a client in real-time. It uses an HTTP connection to send a stream of data from the server to the client, and the client can listen for these events and take action when they are received.</p>
<p>SSE is useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat systems, stock tickers, and social media feeds. It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.</p>
<p>To use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting.</p>
