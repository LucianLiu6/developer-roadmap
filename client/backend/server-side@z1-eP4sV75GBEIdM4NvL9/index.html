<p>Server-side caching temporarily stores web files and data on the origin server to reuse later.</p>
<p>When the user first requests for the webpage, the website goes under the normal process of retrieving data from the server and generates or constructs the webpage of the website. After the request has happened and the response has been sent back, the server copies the webpage and stores it as a cache.</p>
<p>Next time the user revisits the website, it loads the already saved or cached copy of the webpage, thus making it faster.</p>
