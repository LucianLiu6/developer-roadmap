<p>NodeJS and NPM allow two methods of installing dependencies/packages: Local and Global. This is mainly used when adding a package or dependency as part of a specific project youâ€™re working on. The package would be installed (with its dependencies) in <code>node_modules</code> folder <strong>under your project</strong>. In addition, in <code>package.json</code> file there will be a new line added for the installed dependency under the label <code>dependencies</code>. At this point - you can start using the package in your NodeJS code by importing the package. Unlike the local install, you can install packages and dependencies <strong>globally</strong>. This would install it in a system path, and these packages would be available to any program which runs on <strong>this specific</strong> computer. This method is often used for installing command line tools (for example, even <code>npm</code> program is a Globally installed npm package).</p>
