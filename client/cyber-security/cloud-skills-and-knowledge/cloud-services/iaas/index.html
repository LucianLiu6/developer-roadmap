<p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers virtualized computing resources over the internet. Essentially, it enables you to rent IT infrastructure—such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking—on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of buying and maintaining your own physical hardware.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<p>IaaS provides a wide range of services and resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalable Virtual Machines</strong>: Quickly provision and scale virtual machines based on your requirements, with various configurations for CPU cores, RAM, and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managed Storage</strong>: Access various storage options such as block storage, object storage, and file storage to suit your application and data needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Networking</strong>: Create virtual networks, configure subnets, manage IPs, and set up VPNs to connect your cloud environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Implement security measures like firewalls, access control policies, and encryption to protect your infrastructure and data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation &#x26; Integration</strong>: Utilize APIs and other tools to automate tasks and integrate with third-party services.</p>
