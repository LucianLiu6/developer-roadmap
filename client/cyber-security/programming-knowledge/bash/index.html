<p>Bash (<strong>B</strong>ourne <strong>A</strong>gain <strong>Sh</strong>ell) is a widely-used Unix shell and scripting language that acts as a command-line interface for executing commands and organizing files on your computer. It allows users to interact with the system’s operating system by typing text commands, serving as an alternative to the graphical user interface (GUI). Bash, created as a free and improved version of the original Bourne Shell (<code>sh</code>), is the default shell in many Unix-based systems, including Linux, macOS, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p>
<h2 id="bash-scripting">Bash Scripting</h2>
<p>Bash scripting is an essential skill for anyone engaged in cyber security. It allows you to automate simple tasks, monitor system activities, and manage multiple files and directories with ease. With Bash scripts, you can develop tools, automate repetitive tasks, or even develop security testing tools.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Variables</strong>: Variables can store data in the form of strings or numbers, which can be used and manipulated throughout your script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Structures</strong>: Bash supports loops (<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>) and conditional statements (<code>if</code>, <code>case</code>) to build more robust scripts with decision-making capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functions</strong>: Create reusable code blocks that can be called with specified parameters, making your script more modular and easier to maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Input</strong>: Bash scripts allow you to interact with the user by accepting input or choosing options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File Management</strong>: Create, modify, or analyze files using built-in commands such as <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, and <code>grep</code>.</p>
