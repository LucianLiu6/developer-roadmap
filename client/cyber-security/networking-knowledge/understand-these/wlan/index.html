<p>A <strong>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)</strong> is a type of local area network that uses wireless communication to connect devices, such as computers and smartphones, within a specific area. Unlike a wired network, which requires physical cables to establish connections, WLANs facilitate connections through radio frequency (RF) signals, providing a more flexible networking option.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-of-wlan">Key Components of WLAN</h2>
<p>There are two main components in a WLAN:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wireless Access Point (WAP)</strong>: A WAP is a networking device that enables wireless devices to connect to the network. It acts as a bridge between the devices and the wired network, converting RF signals into data that can travel through a wired connection.</li>
<li><strong>Wireless Client</strong>: Wireless clients are devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets that are fitted with WLAN adapters. These adapters enable devices to send and receive wireless signals to connect with the WAP.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-wlan-standards">Key WLAN Standards</h2>
<p>There are several WLAN standards, defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 series. Some of the most common standards include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>802.11a</strong>: Supports throughput up to 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz frequency band.</li>
<li><strong>802.11b</strong>: Supports throughput up to 11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.</li>
<li><strong>802.11g</strong>: Supports throughput up to 54 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and is backward compatible with 802.11b.</li>
<li><strong>802.11n</strong>: Supports throughput up to 600 Mbps and operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.</li>
<li><strong>802.11ac</strong>: Supports throughput up to several Gigabits per second and operates in the 5 GHz frequency band. This is currently the most widely adopted standard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wlan-security">WLAN Security</h2>
<p>As WLANs use wireless signals to transmit data, they can be susceptible to various security threats. Some essential security measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</strong>: An early security protocol that uses encryption to protect wireless communications. Due to several security flaws, it has been replaced by more secure protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)</strong>: WPA is an enhanced security protocol that addressed the vulnerabilities of WEP. It uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption and provides better authentication and encryption methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)</strong>: WPA2 is an advanced security protocol that uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption and replaces TKIP from WPA. This protocol provides a high level of security and is currently the recommended standard for securing WLANs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)</strong>: WPA3 is the latest security standard with enhanced encryption and authentication features. It addresses the vulnerabilities in WPA2 and provides even stronger security for WLANs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To maintain a secure WLAN, itâ€™s essential to use the appropriate security standard, change default settings, and regularly update firmware to address any security vulnerabilities.</p>
