<p>In this section, we will discuss various troubleshooting tools that you can use to diagnose and resolve network-related issues. Possessing a strong understanding of these tools is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient network.</p>
<h2 id="ping">Ping</h2>
<p><code>Ping</code> is a basic command-line tool used to test the reachability of a network host. It sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the target host and waits for an ICMP Echo Reply. If the target host is reachable, you will receive the packets back with round-trip time statistics.</p>
<p>Usage: <code>ping [target host/IP]</code></p>
<h2 id="traceroutetracert">Traceroute/tracert</h2>
<p><code>traceroute</code> (Linux) and <code>tracert</code> (Windows) are command-line tools used to display the path taken by packets across a network. They can help to identify routing problems, latency, and packet loss.</p>
<p>Usage: <code>traceroute [target host/IP]</code> or <code>tracert [target host/IP]</code></p>
<h2 id="nslookup">Nslookup</h2>
<p><code>nslookup</code> is a network administration command-line tool used to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers for host information or IP address resolution.</p>
<p>Usage: <code>nslookup [hostname]</code></p>
<h2 id="netstat">Netstat</h2>
<p>The <code>netstat</code> command is a versatile command-line tool that displays network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics. It can help identify critical connections, open ports, and listening services.</p>
<p>Usage: <code>netstat [-options]</code></p>
<h2 id="nmap">Nmap</h2>
<p><code>Nmap</code> (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can scan for open ports, running services, and identify network vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Usage: <code>nmap [-options] [target host/IP]</code></p>
<h2 id="wireshark">Wireshark</h2>
<p><code>Wireshark</code> is a widely-used network protocol analyzer that allows you to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. It provides detailed information about packets, protocols, and network behavior that aids in troubleshooting and security analysis.</p>

<p>Understanding these troubleshooting tools and their applications will help you resolve network issues more effectively and maintain a secure IT infrastructure. Remember to balance security and functionality when managing your network. Practicing good cyber hygiene, staying updated with the latest threats, and continuously assessing your network security will help you stay one step ahead of potential attackers.</p>
