<p>VirtualBox is a powerful, open-source and feature-rich virtualization software created by Oracle Corporation. It allows users to set up and run multiple guest operating systems, referred to as “virtual machines” (VMs), within a single host computer. VirtualBox operates on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris, making it highly versatile for different users and environments.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-platform compatibility</strong>: VirtualBox can be installed and used on a variety of host operating systems. This is beneficial for users who work with multiple platforms and require access to different applications or environments across them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Snapshot functionality</strong>: This feature allows users to take a snapshot of their virtual machine, capturing its current state. This can be useful for testing updates or changes, as users can revert to their previous snapshot if conflicts or issues arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>USB device support</strong>: VirtualBox allows users to access USB devices connected to their host computer, such as flash drives, printers, or webcams, from within their guest operating system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shared folders</strong>: Users can easily share files between their host system and virtual machines using a shared folder feature. This simplifies file transfers and resource sharing between your host computer and your virtual environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
