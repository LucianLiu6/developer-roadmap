<p>Understanding IP Terminology is essential in grasping the fundamentals of networking and cybersecurity. In this section, we’ll cover essential terms in the world of IP networks.</p>
<h2 id="internet-protocol-ip">Internet Protocol (IP)</h2>
<p>IP is a protocol that enables data exchange between computers over a network. Each device in the network has a unique IP address, enabling data packets to be sent correctly.</p>
<h2 id="ipv4-and-ipv6">IPv4 and IPv6</h2>
<p><em>IPv4</em>: It’s the fourth version of IP, using 32-bit addresses and allowing a total of about 4.3 billion unique addresses.</p>
<p><em>IPv6</em>: To overcome the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced. It expands the number of unique addresses by using 128-bit addresses, providing a virtually limitless pool of addresses.</p>
<h2 id="ip-address">IP Address</h2>
<p>An IP address is a unique identifier for devices on the internet or a local network. It helps in routing the data packets between different devices in the network.</p>
<h2 id="subnets">Subnets</h2>
<p>A subnet is a smaller, designated portion of a network. Subnet masks help to define and isolate each subnet to manage traffic.</p>
<h2 id="dhcp-dynamic-host-configuration-protocol">DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</h2>
<p>DHCP is a protocol that assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices when they connect to a network, as opposed to static IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="dns-domain-name-system">DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
<p>DNS is the system responsible for translating human-readable domain names like <a href="http://www.example.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.example.com</a> into IP addresses so that data can be routed correctly.</p>
<h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>
<p>A port is a communication endpoint within a networking device. It allows the device to differentiate multiple connections and applications. Protocols, such as HTTP and FTP, have assigned default ports (80 and 21, respectively).</p>
<h2 id="nat-network-address-translation">NAT (Network Address Translation)</h2>
<p>NAT allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address when connecting to the internet. This conserves the number of IP addresses and adds an additional layer of privacy.</p>
<h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>
<p>A firewall is a security measure that filters, monitors, and controls incoming and outgoing traffic in a network. It helps to protect devices and data from unauthorized access or malicious activities.</p>
<p>By understanding these IP terminologies, you’ll be better equipped to handle networking and cybersecurity tasks.</p>
