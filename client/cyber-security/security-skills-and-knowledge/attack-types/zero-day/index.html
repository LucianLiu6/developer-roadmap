<div data-github-url="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/tree/master/src/data/roadmaps/cyber-security/content/103-security-skills-and-knowledge/attack-types/105-zero-day.md"></div> <h1 id="zero-day">Zero Day</h1>
<p>A <strong>zero day attack</strong> is an exploit that takes advantage of an unknown software vulnerability that has not been discovered, disclosed or patched by the softwareâ€™s developer. This type of attack, also known as an <em>exploit</em>, is particularly dangerous because it exploits a security gap that the vendor is not aware of, meaning there is no existing fix or protection against it.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>There are certain characteristics that make zero day attacks particularly dangerous, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Undetected vulnerability</strong>: Attackers target vulnerabilities in software that developers or manufacturers are not aware of, making it difficult for defenders to protect against the attack.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Zero day attacks are quickly executed, often before any security measures can be implemented, resulting in a higher success rate for attackers.</li>
<li><strong>Stealth</strong>: Attackers usually exploit these vulnerabilities quietly, making their intrusion hard to detect, and can maintain undetected access to a network or system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>Zero day attacks can have serious consequences, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data theft or loss</li>
<li>Damaged systems or infrastructure</li>
<li>Financial losses</li>
<li>Reputation damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations should invest in proactive security measures to protect against such attacks, as reactive measures alone may not be enough.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep software up-to-date</strong>: Regularly update software and apps, as developers often release patches and fixes for known vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Implement multi-layered security</strong>: Employ a combination of robust security solutions, including firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-malware software, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor network and device activity</strong>: Regularly monitor and analyze network and device activities to spot any unusual behavior, potentially indicating an exploit.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypt sensitive data</strong>: By encrypting sensitive data, it becomes harder for hackers to steal and misuse it.</li>
<li><strong>Segment networks</strong>: Segment your networks to limit access to sensitive information and systems, minimizing the damage in case of a breach.</li>
<li><strong>Educate employees</strong>: Provide training for employees about the threat landscape, good security practices, and how to avoid falling victim to phishing or social engineering attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Regular backups and disaster recovery planning</strong>: Routinely and securely back up data and develop a disaster recovery plan to mitigate damages from security breaches or attacks.</li>
</ul>
