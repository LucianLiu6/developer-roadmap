<p><strong>Whois</strong> is a widely-used protocol and tool that allows you to query domain registration and ownership information. It is often useful in the cyber security field for researching and investigating the origins, hosting providers, or administrators associated with a particular domain or IP address.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-whois">How to Use Whois</h2>
<p>There are various ways you can access the Whois database, as listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Command Line</strong>: Most operating systems come with a command-line version of Whois. For example, you can simply open your command prompt or terminal and type in <code>whois example.com</code> to find information about <code>example.com</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Websites</strong>: Many websites offer specialized Whois lookup services, such as <a href="https://whois.icann.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ICANN’s Whois Lookup</a> and <a href="https://www.whois.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Whois.net</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software Tools</strong>: You can use specialized software tools like <a href="http://network-tools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Network-Tools</a> and <a href="https://www.webhostinghero.com/whois-finder/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WebHostingHero Whois Finder</a> to access the Whois database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whois-information">Whois Information</h2>
<p>When performing a Whois query, you may typically find the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain registrar</strong>: The company that registers and manages the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain owner</strong>: The person or organization responsible for the domain, including their name, address, phone number, and email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain’s creation, expiration, and last update dates</strong>: These dates can be useful to determine the age and history of a domain, as well as checking for recent changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain status</strong>: This can include <code>active</code>, <code>inactive</code>, <code>pending</code>, <code>locked</code>, or <code>expired</code>, depending on the current state of the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain’s name servers</strong>: These are the servers responsible for resolving the domain to its corresponding IP address(es).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy--limitations">Privacy &#x26; Limitations</h2>
<p>It is important to note that Whois information may not always be accurate, as domain owners can provide false information or use privacy protection services to mask their identity. Additionally, some registrars may limit the number of Whois queries from a single IP address, which can limit the usefulness of Whois in some scenarios.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Whois is a valuable tool for understanding domain registration and ownership information. It can be used by cyber security professionals, among others, to investigate potentially malicious websites or domains, identify patterns or relationships among sites, and gain insights into a domain’s history and ownership. Remember to consider the limitations of the information obtained through Whois and always verify the gathered information through various sources.</p>
