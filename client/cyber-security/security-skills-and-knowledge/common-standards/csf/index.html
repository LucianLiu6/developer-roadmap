<h2 id="cybersecurity-framework-csf-summary">Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Summary</h2>
<p>The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines aimed at helping organizations better protect their critical infrastructure from cyber threats. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this voluntary framework provides a flexible, risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risks.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-of-csf">Key Components of CSF</h2>
<p>CSF comprises three key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Core</strong> - Consists of five functions, each representing a high-level cybersecurity activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify: Understand the organization’s cybersecurity risks.</li>
<li>Protect: Implement safeguards to protect the critical infrastructure.</li>
<li>Detect: Identify the occurrence of a potential cybersecurity event.</li>
<li>Respond: Develop and implement appropriate actions to address detected cybersecurity events.</li>
<li>Recover: Implement plans to restore systems and services after a cybersecurity incident.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tiers</strong> - Provide context for organizations to consider the robustness of their cybersecurity program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: Partial – Minimal cybersecurity risk management practices.</li>
<li>Tier 2: Risk Informed – Risk management practices in place, but not consistently applied.</li>
<li>Tier 3: Repeatable – Risk management practices are consistent across the organization.</li>
<li>Tier 4: Adaptive – Proactive approach to managing cybersecurity risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profiles</strong> - Organizations create profiles to align their cybersecurity activities with their organizational goals, risk tolerance, and resources. A target profile represents desired outcomes, whereas a current profile reflects the current state of cybersecurity programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-implementing-csf">Benefits of Implementing CSF</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced understanding of cybersecurity risks and corresponding management strategies within an organization.</li>
<li>Improved ability to prioritize cybersecurity investments based on risk assessments.</li>
<li>Strengthened communication between different departments and stakeholders regarding cybersecurity expectations and progress.</li>
<li>Compliance with industry standards and guidelines, including support for organizations subject to regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>CSF offers organizations a structured approach to improving their cybersecurity posture. By following this framework, organizations can manage their cybersecurity risks more effectively, create a stronger defense against cyberattacks, and maintain the resilience of their critical infrastructure.</p>
