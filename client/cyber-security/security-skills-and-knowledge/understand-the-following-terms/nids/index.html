<p>A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security solution that monitors network traffic for any suspicious activity, malicious threats, or policy violations. This system primarily focuses on detecting attacks from both external and internal sources. NIDS plays a critical role in protecting valuable information assets and maintaining overall network security.</p>
<p>Here are some key features of NIDS:</p>
<h2 id="passive-monitoring">Passive Monitoring</h2>
<p>NIDS observes network traffic passively, without interfering or causing any performance impact. By silently monitoring network activity, NIDS detects suspicious activities in real-time without disrupting regular network operations.</p>
<h2 id="traffic-analysis">Traffic Analysis</h2>
<p>NIDS inspects network packets and observes their content and behavior. Network traffic patterns are analyzed against predefined rules or signatures of known threats, which helps determine if a network intrusion is taking place.</p>
<h2 id="threat-and-policy-violations-identification">Threat and Policy Violations Identification</h2>
<p>NIDS identifies possible attacks or intrusions by comparing network activity against known threat signatures or user-defined policies. When activities match a specific pattern or when policy violations occur, the system generates an alert, logs the incident, and may take appropriate action to mitigate the threat.</p>
<h2 id="alert-and-response">Alert and Response</h2>
<p>In the event of a detected threat or policy violation, NIDS produces alerts and reports to provide administrators with crucial information about the event. Depending on the configuration, the system may also respond by blocking the suspicious traffic, isolating the affected device, or taking other pre-defined actions.</p>
<p>Implementing NIDS as a part of your cyber security strategy is an essential step for ensuring the ongoing integrity and confidentiality of your network environment.</p>
