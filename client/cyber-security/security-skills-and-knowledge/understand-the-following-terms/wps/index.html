<p>Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature available in many Wi-Fi routers and access points that is designed to simplify the process of connecting devices to a wireless network. With WPS, users can easily connect to a secure Wi-Fi network without the need for manually entering the networkâ€™s password.</p>
<p>There are multiple methods for using WPS, some of which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-button method</strong>: This is the most common method of using WPS. The user simply pushes the WPS button on the router, and then on the device they want to connect within a certain time period. This automatically establishes a secure connection between the device and the router.</li>
<li><strong>PIN method</strong>: In this method, a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) is generated by the router or access point, which the user must then enter on the device they wish to connect.</li>
<li><strong>NFC method</strong>: Some devices come with near-field communication (NFC) capabilities, allowing users to establish a secure connection by simply tapping their device against the router or access point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WPS can provide ease of use and quick connectivity, it has some security concerns. The main concern arises from the PIN method, as the 8-digit PINs are susceptible to brute force attacks. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a network. As a result, many cyber security experts recommend disabling WPS or using the push-button method only.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while WPS can make connecting devices to a wireless network more convenient, its associated security risks make it essential for users to be aware of best practices to protect their networks.</p>
