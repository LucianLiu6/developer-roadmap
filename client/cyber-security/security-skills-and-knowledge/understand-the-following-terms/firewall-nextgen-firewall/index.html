<p>A <strong>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)</strong> is an advanced type of firewall that goes beyond traditional network security by providing more in-depth inspection, visibility, and control over network traffic. It is designed to defend against modern-day threats and sophisticated attacks.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-next-generation-firewalls">Key features of Next-Generation Firewalls:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Application awareness:</strong> NGFWs can identify and control applications running on a network, regardless of the port or protocol used. This provides more granular control over network traffic and enhances security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):</strong> Next-gen firewalls come with built-in IPS capabilities, which helps in detecting and blocking potential threats and vulnerabilities in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User identity awareness:</strong> NGFWs can track and enforce security policies based on user identities (rather than just IP addresses), providing better visibility and control over user activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced threat protection:</strong> Next-gen firewalls often include features like sandboxing and threat intelligence to detect and block advanced threats such as zero-day attacks, ransomware, and targeted attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSL/TLS inspection:</strong> NGFWs can decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS encrypted traffic, enabling the detection of threats hidden within encrypted communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralized management and reporting:</strong> These firewalls offer a centralized management console to easily manage security policies and monitor network activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining these advanced protection features, Next-Generation Firewalls provide enhanced visibility and control, enabling organizations to effectively secure their networks in todayâ€™s complex and ever-evolving cyber-threat landscape.</p>
