<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, detecting and preventing intrusions is crucial for protecting valuable information systems and networks. In this section, weâ€™ll discuss the basics of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to help you better understand their function and importance in your overall cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-intrusion-detection-system-ids">What is Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?</h2>
<p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a critical security tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic or host activities for any signs of malicious activity, policy violations, or unauthorized access attempts. Once a threat or anomaly is identified, the IDS raises an alert to the security administrator for further investigation and possible actions.</p>
<p>There are two types of IDS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)</strong>: This type of IDS is deployed on network devices such as routers, switches, or firewalls to monitor and analyze the traffic between hosts within the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)</strong>: This type of IDS is installed on individual hosts, such as servers or workstations, to monitor and analyze the activities on that specific host.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-intrusion-prevention-system-ips">What is Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?</h2>
<p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an advanced security solution closely related to IDS. While an IDS mainly focuses on detecting and alerting about intrusions, an IPS takes it a step further and actively works to prevent the attacks. It monitors, analyzes, and takes pre-configured automatic actions based on suspicious activities, such as blocking malicious traffic, reseting connections, or dropping malicious packets.</p>
<p>There are two types of IPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Network-Based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)</strong>: This type of IPS is deployed in-line with network devices and closely monitors network traffic, making it possible to take actions in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)</strong>: This type of IPS is installed on individual hosts and actively prevents attacks by controlling inputs and outputs on the host, restricting access to resources, and making use of application-level controls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>IDS and IPS are essential components of a robust cybersecurity strategy.</li>
<li>IDS focuses on detecting and alerting about potential intrusions, while IPS takes it further by actively preventing and mitigating attacks.</li>
<li>Network-based systems protect networks, while host-based systems protect individual hosts within a network.</li>
<li>Regularly updating and configuring IDS/IPS is necessary to continually defend against evolving threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding the basics of IDS and IPS, you can better evaluate your security needs and take the right steps to protect your network and hosts from potential intruders.</p>
