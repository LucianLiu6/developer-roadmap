<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery, or CSRF, is a type of attack that exploits the trust that a user’s browser has in a web application. It tricks the user’s browser into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which the user is currently authenticated.</p>
<h2 id="how-csrf-works">How CSRF Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>A user logs into a vulnerable web application.</li>
<li>The web application returns a cookie to the user’s browser, indicating that the user is authenticated.</li>
<li>The attacker creates a malicious link or embeds malicious HTML/JavaScript code on another website.</li>
<li>The user, while still authenticated to the web application, visits the attacker’s website, which triggers the malicious code.</li>
<li>The attacker’s code sends a request to the targeted web application, leveraging the user’s authenticated cookie.</li>
<li>The vulnerable web application performs the malicious action as if the request came from the user.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-of-csrf-attacks">Impact of CSRF Attacks</h2>
<p>CSRF attacks can result in unauthorized actions being performed on a user’s behalf, often without the user’s knowledge. Consequences might include unauthorized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data modifications</li>
<li>Privilege escalation</li>
<li>Account takeovers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prevention-measures">Prevention Measures</h2>
<p>Here are some techniques to help prevent CSRF attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use CSRF Tokens:</strong> Implement a unique, unpredictable token in each sensitive request (e.g., form submissions) to ensure that the request originates from the same domain.</li>
<li><strong>Double-submit Cookies:</strong> Generate a unique token for each session and include it as a hidden value in forms, then validate it against the corresponding session cookie.</li>
<li><strong>SameSite Cookies:</strong> Use the <code>SameSite</code> attribute in cookies to instruct the browser to only send the cookie when the request originates from the same domain.</li>
<li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Implement a CSP header to mitigate cross-site scripting, which can be a vector for CSRF attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Restrict CORS:</strong> Limit Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to trusted domains to prevent unauthorized communication between different origins.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding and applying these preventive measures, the risk of CSRF attacks can be significantly reduced, enhancing the overall safety and security of web applications.</p>
