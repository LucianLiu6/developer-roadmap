<p>Directory traversal, also known as path traversal, is a type of cyber attack that allows an attacker to access restricted files and directories on a server, usually with the goal of obtaining sensitive information. This vulnerability occurs when user input is not adequately validated and the attacker can manipulate it to traverse the server directory structure.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
<p>In a directory traversal attack, the attacker attempts to exploit an input field (e.g., a file or image upload form, URL parameters, etc.) that takes a file path as input. By supplying specially crafted input, an attacker can manipulate the server into providing access to unauthorized files and directories.</p>
<p>For example, consider a web application that allows users to view the contents of a specific file by specifying its path through a URL parameter, such as:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>https://www.example.com/file.php?path=/user/documents/report.pdf</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, an attacker could manipulate the <code>path</code> parameter to traverse the server’s directories, like this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>https://www.example.com/file.php?path=../../../../etc/passwd</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>If the server doesn’t properly validate and sanitize the input, it might reveal the contents of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, which contains sensitive information about system users.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation-techniques">Mitigation Techniques</h2>
<p>There are several methods to prevent directory traversal attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Ensure that user input is strictly validated and sanitized. For example, one can check for the presence of special characters (e.g., ’..’, ’/’, ”), disallowing them if found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control:</strong> Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to files and directories. For example, use a whitelist approach to establish which files and directories the user is allowed to access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> Practice the principle of least privilege by ensuring that an application runs with only the necessary permissions needed for its operation. This can minimize the potential impact of a directory traversal attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Chroot Jails:</strong> Deploy applications inside chroot jails to restrict access to a certain directory, thwarting attempts to traverse outside that directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these countermeasures, you can minimize the risk of directory traversal attacks and help protect your system’s critical files and directories.</p>
