<p>At this point, you should be able to install and use external packages using <code>npm</code>. You probably know about <a href="https://npmjs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">npmjs.com</a> where you can search for packages and read their documentation. You should also be familiar with the <code>package.json</code> file and how to use it to manage your project dependencies.</p>
<p>You donâ€™t need to get into the module bundlers and build tools just yet. Just make sure that you are able to use the dependencies installed in the <code>node_modules</code> folder using simple link and script tags in your HTML.</p>
<p>Regarding projects, here are a few ideas that you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple webpage that shows the current time of user. You can use <a href="https://day.js.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dayjs</a> to get the current time and display it on the page. Here is the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yGIMGkr.png" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sample design for homepage</a>.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://micromodal.vercel.app/#introduction" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">micromodal</a> library. Create a button on the page clicking which should open a modal and let the user select a timezone from a dropdown. Once the user selects a timezone, the modal should close and the time on the page should be updated to show the time in the selected timezone. Here is the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vFY6Sdl" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sample design for the modal</a>.</li>
