<p>At this point you should be able to build a complete frontend application including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structuring your webpages with HTML</li>
<li>Styling your webpages with CSS</li>
<li>Adding interactivity to your webpages with JavaScript</li>
<li>Using the DOM API to manipulate your webpages</li>
<li>Using the Fetch API to make HTTP requests</li>
<li>Understand promises and use <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax to write asynchronous code</li>
<li>Installing and using external libraries with npm</li>
<li>Version controlling your code with Git</li>
<li>Pushing your code to GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decided to skip React and Tailwind for now, that is fine also but you should be able to build a complete frontend application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, keep in mind that the modern frontend applications are mostly built with frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. So, you should learn at least one of them at any point of time.</p>
<p>This marks the end of frontend basics that you needed, we will now be moving to the backend development. While you continue with the backend development, know that there is more to frontend development and remember to checkout the <a href="/frontend">frontend roadmap</a> later in your journey.</p>
