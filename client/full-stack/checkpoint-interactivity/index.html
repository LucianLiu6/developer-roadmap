<p>At this point you should be able to add interactivity to your web pages using JavaScript. You should make sure that you have learnt the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know about variables, loops, data types, conditionals, functions.</li>
<li>Know about arrays and objects and different ways to access their data.</li>
<li>Know how to select DOM elements.</li>
<li>Add event listeners to DOM elements (e.g. click, focus, form submission).</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to add and remove DOM elements</li>
<li>Add and remove classes from DOM elements</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to make HTTP requests to external APIs (i.e. <code>fetch</code>)</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to store data in the browser’s local storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are few ideas to practice your skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple to-do list app that allows users to search, add, edit, and delete items. Use local storage to store the data.</li>
<li>Create a simple webpage where user can put in anyone’s GitHub username and see their profile information. You can use GitHub’s API to fetch the data. For example, here is the <a href="https://api.github.com/users/kamranahmedse" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sample URL to fetch my data</a>. Make sure to add validation and error handling.</li>
<li>Create a basic calculator app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.</li>
</ul>
