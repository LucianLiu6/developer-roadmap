<p>At this point, you should have everything that you need to build a complete application that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a responsive frontend that users can interact with</li>
<li>Has a backend API that is secured with JWT authentication</li>
<li>Has a database that stores data</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you should practice building as much as you can on your own to solidify your knowledge. If you need inspiration, here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a simple blogging application where users can register, login, setup their blog and write posts.</li>
<li>A single page site builder where users can pick a template, modify it and publish it. <strong>Hint</strong> you will need filesystem to store the design templates. Template files will have placeholders that you will need to replace with user data.</li>
<li>Build a simple e-commerce application which will have two types of users i.e. <strong>Sellers</strong> who can: Register as Seller, Login, Setup their store, Add products, Edit products, Delete products, View Received Orders, Update Order Status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered), <strong>Buyers</strong> who can register, Login, Browse products by all sellers, Add products to cart, Checkout, View order history, View order status, Cancel order, View seller profile, View seller products</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some ideas to get you started. You can build anything you want. The goal is to practice building a complete application from scratch.</p>
