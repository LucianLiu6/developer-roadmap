<p>This roadmap specifically covers <strong>React and the ecosystem</strong> around it. You will notice that it is missing things like version control, package managers, build tools, linters, task runners and other things that are not directly related to React; this is intentional. Have a look at the <a href="/frontend">Frontend Roadmap</a> for a more comprehensive overview of the frontend ecosystem.</p>
