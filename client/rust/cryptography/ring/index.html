<p><code>Ring</code> is a popular cryptography library in Rust providing a safe, fast and easy-to-use platform for handling a broad range of cryptographic operations. The library supports a variety of cryptographic primitives, including RSA, AES, SHA, and many others. <code>Ring</code> is focused on the implementation of TLS protocol and cryptographic algorithm fundamentals, hence it doesnâ€™t include functionalities like parsing or serialization. This library excels in eliminating many common pitfalls of crypto usage by asserting on compile-time and runtime checks. One key feature is its limitation to safe, reviewed cryptographic algorithms, which enables it to help prevent accidental usage of insecure ones.</p>
