<p>Atomic operations in Rust are low-level types that support lock-free concurrent programming. These operations are atomic because they complete in a single operation rather than being interruptible. In Rust, atomic types provide primitive shared-memory communication between threads, and can also be used for non-blocking data structures and are supported using machine instructions directly. They form the building blocks for other, higher-level concurrency abstractions. It includes variety of atomic operations such as <code>store</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>swap</code>, <code>fetch_add</code>, <code>compare_and_swap</code> and more, which are operations performed in a single, uninterrupted step.</p>
