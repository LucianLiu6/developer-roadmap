<p>Threads are the smallest unit of computing that can be scheduled by an operating system. They live in the context of a process, and each thread within a process shares the processâ€™s resources including memory and file handles. In Rust, the <code>std::thread</code> module allows you to have direct control over threads. This model of concurrency is known as 1:1, mapping one operating system thread to one language thread. You can write concurrent programs in Rust using threads in a similar way as most other languages. You start threads with <code>std::thread::spawn</code> and wait for them to finish with <code>join</code>.</p>
