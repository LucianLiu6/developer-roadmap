<p>Error handling in Rust is achieved primarily through two types of results: the <code>Result&#x3C;T, E></code> and <code>Option&#x3C;T></code>. The <code>Result&#x3C;T, E></code> variant is used for functions that can result in an error. It has two variants, <code>Ok(T)</code> which indicates operation was successful and <code>Err(E)</code> when an error occurred. On the other hand, <code>Option&#x3C;T></code> is used for functions that can return a <code>none</code> value but not cause an error. This result type also has two variants, <code>Some(T)</code> indicates that the operation was successful and <code>None</code> specifies absence of a value. Rust’s pattern matching features can be used to handle different types of errors thrown by these results. Furthermore, propagation of errors in Rust can be achieved using the <code>?</code> operator that returns early if the function fails. It’s important to note that Rust does not have exceptions, thus eliminates the common problems associated with them.</p>
