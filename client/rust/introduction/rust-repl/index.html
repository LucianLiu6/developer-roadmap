<p><code>Rust REPL</code> (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) is an interactive shell in which you can write and test Rust snippets in real-time. Unlike running a program normally in Rust where you have to manually compile and then run the program, REPL automatically evaluates your inputs, and the result is returned immediately after execution. This is helpful when experimenting with Rust code, learning the language, and debugging. REPL isnâ€™t built into Rust directly, but is available via third-party tools such as <code>evcxr_repl</code>.</p>
