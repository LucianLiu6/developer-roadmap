<p><code>smol</code> is a small, fast, and modern async runtime for Rust programming language. It is built on top of async-std and tokio. With very few lines of code, it allows users to perform tasks such as creating async functions, waiting on a future, creating a timer, among others. Although it is feature-rich, smol keeps its API minimal and clean, making it the go-to choice for many developers working with Rust. It supports async/.await natively and is highly efficient due to its superior scheduling capabilities.</p>
