<p>Async programming, short for asynchronous programming, in Rust allows the execution of tasks concurrently instead of sequentially. This means that you donâ€™t have to wait for a function to complete all its tasks before another function starts executing. As Rust is a systems programming language and is quite close to the hardware, async programming can provide efficient usage of resources, especially in IO-heavy applications. To facilitate async programming, <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> were introduced into Rust. <code>async</code> annotifies a function is asynchronous and can return <code>Future</code>, while <code>await</code> is used to pause and resume an <code>async</code> function. To manage tasks efficiently, Rust also provides async runtimes such as Tokio and async-std.</p>
