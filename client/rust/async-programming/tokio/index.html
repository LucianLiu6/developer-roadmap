<p>Tokio, a Rust framework for developing applications, is used primarily for asynchronous programming that enables you to write asynchronous inputs/output, networking, and other features. Its primary function is to deliver high-performance, reliable, and easy-to-use asynchronous event-driven platform. It is built on the futures library and uses the async/await syntax of Rust for readability purposes. Tokio’s ‘runtime’ provides I/O driver functions, scheduling and timers offering a foundation for asynchronous programming. It is designed to handle a high volume of network connections concurrently, making it ideal for building network applications.</p>
