<p><code>Druid</code> is an open-source, data-oriented Rust GUI framework. It is focused on giving users a seamless and robust way of creating GUI interfaces in Rust while also providing them with a high level of control. <code>Druid</code> uses a reactive-model similar to <code>React</code> but it has its own distinguishing features, as well. <code>Druid</code> includes features such as flexbox styling, data binding, and event handling. It provides platform-native look-and-feel by utilizing the platformâ€™s own widget. Currently, <code>Druid</code> supports various platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and Redox.</p>
