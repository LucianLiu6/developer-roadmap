<p><code>relm</code> is a declarative, event-driven framework for building GUIs in Rust. It is asynchronous and designed to handle complex user interfaces. <code>relm</code> uses <code>gtk-rs</code>, a wrapper for GTK+3, allowing for the creation of cross-platform GUI applications. Features in <code>relm</code> include Widget identification through name instead of Arc&#x3C;Mutex&#x3C;>>, asynchronicity framework using Futures, and seamless communication between widgets through the Model-View-Update architecture. The main focus of <code>relm</code> is to enable the creation of dynamic desktop applications with complex interactions, using the safe concurrency features of Rust.</p>
