<p><code>rustdoc</code> is a tool that comes bundled with Rust by default. It is primarily used to generate documentation for Rust projects. <code>rustdoc</code> takes into consideration both the comments and the source code to produce comprehensive documentation. The resultant documentation can be viewed through a web server or a web browser. The uniqueness of <code>rustdoc</code> lies in its testing feature. It can test the code snippets present in your documentation, ensuring that your examples are accurate and up-to-date. It is the de facto tool for all Rust developers to create and maintain their project documentation.</p>
