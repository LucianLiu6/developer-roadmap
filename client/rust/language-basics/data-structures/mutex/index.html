<p><code>Mutex</code> or “Mutual Exclusion” in Rust is a concurrency primitive that is used to protect shared data from being concurrently accessed by multiple threads. When one thread starts using a <code>Mutex</code>, other threads have to wait until the Mutex is unlocked. When a thread has finished handling the shared data, it should unlock the <code>Mutex</code> to allow other threads to access the shared data. If not properly handled, it could lead to a software deadlock or other timing-related issues. Rust’s Mutex has a built-in safeguard against these problems – if a thread that is holding a Mutex crashes, Rust will automatically unlock the Mutex.</p>
