<p>In Rust, there are different types of data structures for organizing and storing data. Some of the primary types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structures (structs)</strong>: These are custom data types that allow you to combine multiple related values of different types. Structs implement methods and can also maintain private fields. Structs come in three types: classic C-style structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.</li>
<li><strong>Tuples</strong>: These are a sequence of fixed-size elements of possibly differing types. The elements of a tuple can be accessed using dot notation followed by the index starting from 0.</li>
<li><strong>Enums (enumerations)</strong>: These are data structures that allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Enum variants can be simple values or complex ones with fields.</li>
<li><strong>Arrays</strong> and <strong>Vectors</strong>: These are collections of items with the same type. An array is fixed-sized, while a vector can grow or shrink its size. Arrays and vectors store elements in contiguous memory locations.</li>
<li><strong>Hash Maps</strong>: A Hash Map keeps track of elements in key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary or a JavaScript object. They are great for quick lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust language also provides powerful reference and borrowing mechanism to control memory, data read/write access, and mutation to avoid problems like data races in concurrent scenarios.</p>
