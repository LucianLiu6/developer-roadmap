<p><code>HashSet</code> in Rust is a collection of unique elements. It’s a data structure which stores details in the form of key and value, and it uses <code>hashing</code> to store elements. It’s implemented as a <code>hash table</code>, as it makes use of a hasher to make the structure more secure against collision attacks. A <code>HashSet</code> only contains keys, associating the value portion of the map with a dummy unit. The value of <code>HashSet</code> returns an iterator over the elements of the set and these elements are arbitrary and not in any specific order.</p>
