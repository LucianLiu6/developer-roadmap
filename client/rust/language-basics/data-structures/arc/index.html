<p><code>Arc</code> in Rust stands for “Atomic Reference Counting”. It is a thread-safe reference-counting type used for sharing immutable data between multiple parts of the system. With <code>Arc</code>, we can have multiple references to the same data which is useful for concurrent programming. When the last reference to a type is gone, the <code>Arc</code> will clean up the underlying data. Unlike <code>Rc</code> (Reference Counting), which is single-threaded, <code>Arc</code> uses atomic operations for incrementing and decrementing the reference count hence making it safe to share across threads.</p>
