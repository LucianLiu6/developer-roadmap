<p>In Rust, a struct is a custom data type used for grouping related values together into one entity. Structs are similar to classes in other programming languages. Essentially, each <code>struct</code> creates a new type that we can use to streamline complex data handling.</p>
<p>There are three types of <code>struct</code> in Rust: classic ‘C’ structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic ‘C’ structs</strong> are named-field structs and are the most commonly used.</li>
<li><strong>Tuple structs</strong>, while not being common, are useful when you want to couple together just a few data points that don’t need field names.</li>
<li><strong>Unit structs</strong> are useful in situations where you want to implement a <strong>trait</strong> on some type, but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.</li>
</ul>
