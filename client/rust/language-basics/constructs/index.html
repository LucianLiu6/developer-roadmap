<p>In Rust, “constructs” refer to different elements used to build the structure of the program. Constructs includes variables, functions, data types, control flow statements, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables</strong> store data, and their immutable or mutable status is determined at their declaration with <code>let</code> and <code>let mut</code>, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong> are reusable blocks of code defined by the <code>fn</code> keyword.</li>
<li><strong>Data types</strong> in Rust are static and must be declared upfront. These include simple <em>primitive</em> types, like integers, booleans (<code>bool</code>), and floats, as well as <em>complex</em> types like arrays, tuples, all the custom types you declare yourself, and many more types you might use from Rust’s standard library or community crates you download.</li>
<li><strong>Control flow</strong> structures help direct the flow of code execution. These include <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code> blocks, to name a few. Exception handling in Rust leverages the <code>Result&#x3C;T, E></code> and <code>Option&#x3C;T></code> enums alongside the <code>match</code> construct’s ability to perform concise pattern matching.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Rust programmer, you’ll utilize many of the language’s constructs like the ones above. These pieces come together at your fingertips to structure your program in a safe and efficient manner.</p>
