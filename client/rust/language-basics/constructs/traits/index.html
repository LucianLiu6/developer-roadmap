<p>Traits in Rust define behaviors that are shared among different data types. Implementing traits for data types is a great way to group method signatures together and define a set of behaviors your types require. Essentially, anything with a certain <code>trait</code> applied to it will “inherit” the behavior of that trait’s methods, but this is not the same thing as inheritance found in object-oriented programming languages.</p>
<p>Traits are abstract; it’s not possible to create instances of traits. However, we can define pointers of trait types, and these can hold any data type that implements the <code>trait</code>. A <code>trait</code> is <strong>implemented</strong> for something else with the syntax <code>impl TraitAbc for Xyz {...}</code>, which can be a concrete type or another trait.</p>
<p>You should read carefully about traits in Rust and understand how some common traits, like <code>Copy</code>, are already implemented for various primitive types and how this could affect your program.</p>
