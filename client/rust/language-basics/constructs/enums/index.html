<p>An enum, short for enumeration, is a custom data type that allows you to define a type by enumerating (listing out one-by-one) all of its possible variants. In Rust, if something is one of a given set of possibilities (e.g., <code>Rock</code> or <code>Paper</code> or <code>Scissors</code>), it’s probably appropriate to represent that data with an enum, like so: <code>enum RpsChoice { Rock, Paper, Scissors }</code>.</p>
<p>An instance of an <code>enum</code> can be one and only one of the enum’s declared variants at any given time. Unlike enumerations in some other languages, variants in Rust are not restricted to a singular data type. When you define an <code>enum</code>, you can decide for each of its possible variants whether or not that variant will hold additional embedded data; each variant of the enum is also allowed to hold data of completely different types and amounts. You can even embed structs and other enums in a variant, making enums incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>Enums in Rust are one way to enable simple pattern matching for a value, which allows you to compare the interior structure of a value to a series of patterns using a <code>match</code> block. For example, you can execute different branches of code based on whether an <code>RpsChoice</code> value is <code>Rock</code>, <code>Paper</code>, or <code>Scissors</code> without a verbose tree of <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> blocks. You can also handle whatever data might be embedded within that instance of the enum variant, as you will do frequently with Rust’s standard <code>Option&#x3C;T></code> and <code>Result&#x3C;T, E></code> enums.</p>
