<p>In Rust, “borrowing” is a technique which allows you to access the data of a particular value while the owner retains control. There are two types of borrowing: mutable and immutable. Immutable borrowing means an owner can fondly permit several read-only borrows of a value at the same time as long as the value doesn’t change. On the other hand, mutable borrowing allows only a single borrower at a time who can potentially modify the value. This practice is essential in maintaining the concept of ownership without violating any of its rules and avoiding the problem of dangling references.</p>
