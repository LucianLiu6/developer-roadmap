<p>In most modern computer systems, memory management is split into two main parts: the stack and the heap.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>stack</strong> is a section of memory that grows and shrinks automatically as functions are called and return. For data to be stored on the stack, it must have a known, fixed size at compile time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>heap</strong> is a section of memory that is used for data that needs to persist for longer than a single function-call. Data with dynamic size is stored on the heap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust, like many languages, has facilities for using these two types of memory, allowing developers fine-tuned control over memory usage.</p>
