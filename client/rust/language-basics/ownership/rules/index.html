<p>In Rust, the concept of ownership is described by three main rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Each value in Rust has a variable that is called its <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only ever be <em>one owner at a time</em>. This prevents multiple parts of the code from trying to modify the data at once, potentially causing data races and inconsistencies.</li>
<li><em>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped</em>. This ensures that Rust cleans up the allocated memory and other resources once theyâ€™re no longer required, thereby avoiding memory leaks.</li>
</ol>
