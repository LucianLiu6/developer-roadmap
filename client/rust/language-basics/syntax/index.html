<p>Rust’s syntax aims for readability and reduced visual clutter. Rust also places a great deal of importance on forward compatibility, even when it occasionally hinders feature additions.</p>
<p>Most syntax in Rust is built around the same basic principles, so understanding a handful of Rust’s core concepts allows for a broad understanding of the structure of most Rust programs. Examples of Rust’s most widely-used syntactic components are item declarations and pattern matching. In Rust, you typically declare an item once and then refer to it by its name as long as it’s in scope. Pattern matching is a fundamental and powerful part of Rust’s syntax: it allows you to branch code based on the structure of its data, not just its value or type.</p>
<p>It takes time to learn all of Rust’s paradigms for constructing the most robust and elegant pattern matching (e.g., by implementing your own data types). However, even complex pattern matching can be intuitive to read and concise, which is what makes it so powerful.</p>
