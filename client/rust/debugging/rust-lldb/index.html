<p><code>Rust LLDB</code> is a set of modifications made to the LLDB debugger by the Rust developers to enable it to understand Rust-specific data structures and concepts. It allows the developer to drill down into Rust-specific data structures in a meaningful way that the regular LLDB debugger wouldn’t understand. Furthermore, <code>Rust LLDB</code> includes pretty-printers for many common Rust standard library types. It’s worth noting that Rust-enhanced LLDB doesn’t need to be installed separately, it comes bundled with the Rust compiler.</p>
