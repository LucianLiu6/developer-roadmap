<p>In Rust, the <code>std::net</code> module provides functionality for networking. This includes types that represent IP addresses (<code>Ipv4Addr</code> and <code>Ipv6Addr</code>), a socket address (<code>SocketAddr</code>), and TCP/UDP networking types (<code>TcpStream</code>, <code>TcpListener</code>, <code>UdpSocket</code>). There’s also the <code>TcpStream</code> type for connection-oriented sockets, <code>TcpListener</code> for a TCP socket that’s listening for incoming connections, and <code>UdpSocket</code> for connection-less sockets. Rust’s networking interface is built around BSD sockets with methods that closely follow the system’s system calls. The types in this module encompass low-level network primitives, which can be used to build networking applications.</p>
