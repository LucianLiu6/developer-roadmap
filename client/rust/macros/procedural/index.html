<p>Procedural macros in Rust allow you to define functions, or procedures, that operate on code at compile time. The input to these macros is a stream of tokens from the program text, and the output is a new stream of tokens that replace the macro invocation. They are defined in their own crates with a special crate type. There are three kinds of procedural macros: custom derive, attribute-like macros, and function-like macros. Custom derive macros let you define new behavior for the <code>derive</code> attribute. Attribute-like macros are invoked as item attributes, for example <code>#[foo(â€¦)]</code>, and can be applied to any item that accepts attributes. Function-like macros look like function calls, but work with arbitrary tokens as input.</p>
