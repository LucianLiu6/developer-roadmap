<p><code>B trees</code> and <code>B+ trees</code> are both types of self-balancing, sorted, tree-based data structures that maintain sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. A <code>B tree</code> is a tree data structure in which each node has multiple keys and can be in more than two children nodes. Each internal node in a <code>B tree</code> can contain a variable number of keys and pointers. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. One important aspect of a <code>B tree</code> is that every key in the node also appears in the parent node. On the other hand, a <code>B+ tree</code> is an extension of a <code>B tree</code> which allows for efficient traversal of data. In a <code>B+ tree</code>, data pointers are stored only at the leaf nodes of the tree, making every leaf node of a <code>B+ tree</code> a linked list. The intermediary nodes only use the keys to aid with the search.</p>
