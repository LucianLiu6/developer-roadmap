<p>Factorial, often denoted as <code>n!</code>, is a mathematical operation. In the context of computer science and algorithm complexity, it represents an extremely high growth rate. This occurs because of the way a factorial is calculated: The product of all positive integers less than or equal to a non-negative integer <code>n</code>. Thus, if an algorithm has a complexity of O(n!), it means the running time increases factorially based on the size of the input data set. That is, for an input of size <code>n</code>, the algorithm does <code>n</code> * <code>(n-1)</code> * <code>(n-2)</code> * â€¦ * <code>1</code> operations. O(n!) is essentially the worst case scenario of complexity for an algorithm and is seen in brute-force search algorithms, such as the traveling salesman problem via brute-force.</p>
