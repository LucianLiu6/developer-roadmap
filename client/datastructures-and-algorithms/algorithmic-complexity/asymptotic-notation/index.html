<p>In computer science, <strong>asymptotic notation</strong> is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms for large inputs. It is the mathematical notation of the growth rate of an algorithm’s time complexity. The most commonly used notations are <em>O-notation</em> (Big O), <em>Ω-notation</em> (Omega), and <em>Θ-notation</em> (Theta). Big O notation provides an upper bound of the complexity in the worst-case, giving an approximated maximum amount of time taken by an algorithm for any input. Omega notation provides a lower bound of the complexity in the best-case, whereas Theta notation defines a tight bound giving both the lower and upper bound. These notational systems allow for a comparison of the efficiency of algorithms without considering the effect of hardware or software related factors.</p>
