<p><strong>Suffix Trees and Arrays</strong> are advanced data structures used primarily for string manipulation and searches. A <strong>Suffix Tree</strong> is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a given text as their keys and positions as their values. On the other hand, a <strong>Suffix Array</strong> is a sorted array of all possible suffixes of a given text. Both these data structures provide an efficient way to store and search substrings in a text, but differ in terms of space complexity and time complexity.</p>
