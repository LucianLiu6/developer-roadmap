<p>Advanced data structures are an integral part of advanced programming. They include structures such as Binary Search Trees (BST), Balanced trees like AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Heap, Disjoint Data Set, Trie, Suffix Array, Suffix tree and others. BST is a node-based data structure where each node contains a key, a pointer to left child and a pointer to right child. AVL and Red-Black trees are self-balancing binary search trees. Disjoint set data structure supports union and find operations making them useful in computer vision for segmentation. Trie is an ordered tree structure used for faster retrievals, while Suffix Array and Suffix tree are data structures used in pattern matching algorithms. These structures offer an efficient way of manipulating and storing data.</p>
