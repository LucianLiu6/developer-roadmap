<p>Pre Order Traversal is a very specific kind of tree traversal in data structures. In this method of traversal, the process starts from the root node, then proceeds to the left subtree, and finally to the right subtree. To put it concisely, the order of traversal is Root, Left, and Right (often abbreviated as R-L-R). This makes it particularly useful in scenarios where itâ€™s important to duplicate or clone a tree, or to get a prefix expression (Polish notation) of a binary expression tree.</p>
