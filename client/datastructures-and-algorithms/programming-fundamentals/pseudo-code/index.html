<p>Pseudo code is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudo code often uses control structures and terms common to popular high-level programming languages without strictly adhering to the syntax of any particular one. The foremost aim of pseudocode is to explain the inner “algorithmic thinking” behind coding, rather than focusing on the syntax of a particular language. A nice feature of pseudocode is that it is largely able to be understood by a wider range of people than the corresponding code in a specific programming language, which enhances its roles in drafting, documentation, learning, and collaboration aspects.</p>
