<p>Control structures are fundamental elements in most programming languages that facilitate the flow of control through a program. There are three main types of control structures: Sequential, Selection and Iteration. Sequential control structures are the default mode where instructions happen one after another. Selection control structures (often called “conditional” or “decision” structures) allow one set of instructions to be executed if a condition is true and another if it’s false. These typically include <code>if...else</code> statements. Iteration control structures (also known as “loops”) allow a block of code to be repeated multiple times. Common loop structures include <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do...while</code> loops. All these control structures play a vital role in shaping the program logic.</p>
