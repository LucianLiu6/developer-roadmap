<p>Programming Fundamentals are the basic concepts and principles that form the foundation of any computer programming language. These include understanding variables, which store data for processing, control structures such as loops and conditional statements that direct the flow of a program, data structures which organize and store data efficiently, and algorithms which step by step instructions to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks. Mastery of these fundamentals forms the basis for learning any specific programming language and for writing efficient, effective code.</p>
