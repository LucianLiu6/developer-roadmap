<p>Randomised algorithms are a type of algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of the logic of the algorithm. These algorithms use random numbers to make decisions, and thus, even for the same input, can produce different outcomes on different executions. The correctness of these algorithms are probabilistic and they are particularly useful when dealing with a large input space. There are two major types of randomised algorithms: Las Vegas algorithms, which always give the correct answer, but their running time is a random variable; and Mont√© Carlo algorithms, where the algorithm has a small probability of viability or accuracy.</p>
