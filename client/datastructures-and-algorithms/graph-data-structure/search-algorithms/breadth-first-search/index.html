<p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a searching algorithm used to traverse or search in data structures like a tree or a graph. The algorithm starts with a root node and visits the nodes in a level by level manner (i.e., visiting the ones nearest to the root first). It makes use of a queue data structure to store nodes not yet visited. A check is performed before nodes are put in the queue. This is to ensure same node is not visited twice. BFS can be used in multiple areas like finding shortest paths, serialized tree or in test case scenarios where all vertices are equally important.</p>
