<p>Search algorithms are fundamental techniques used for exploring a graph. Two classical methods are <strong>Depth-First Search</strong> (DFS) and <strong>Breadth-First Search</strong> (BFS). <strong>DFS</strong> relies on a stack and the concept of backtracking. Starting from a given node, it explores as far down a path as possible before backtracking. <strong>BFS</strong>, on the other hand, uses a queue and visits all of a node’s neighbors at one level before moving on to the next. For discovering the shortest path between two nodes, Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A* search algorithm are often used. <strong>Dijkstra’s algorithm</strong> builds up a table that provides the shortest distances to each reachable node from a selected starting node. <em><em>A</em> search algorithm</em>*, a modification of Dijkstra’s algorithm, uses a heuristic to provide a best estimate of the path from the current node to the goal, thus often increasing the algorithm’s efficiency.</p>
