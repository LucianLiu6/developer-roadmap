<p>A <strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</strong> is a concept in graph theory where it represents a subset of the edges of a connected, undirected graph. This subset connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. There are quite a few algorithms that can be used to find the MST of a graph such as Prim’s, Kruskal’s, and Boruvka’s algorithm. The concept is important in network design, where the goal is to minimize the total length of the wires yet still connect all of the points.</p>
