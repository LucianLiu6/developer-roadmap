<p><strong>Merge sort</strong> is a type of sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. This algorithm works by dividing an unsorted list into <code>n</code> partitions, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merging partitions to produce new sorted lists until there is only 1 sorted list remaining. This resulting list is the fully sorted list. The process of dividing the list is done recursively until it hits the base case of a list with one item. Merge sort has a time complexity of <code>O(n log n)</code> for all cases (best, average and worst), which makes it highly efficient for large data sets.</p>
