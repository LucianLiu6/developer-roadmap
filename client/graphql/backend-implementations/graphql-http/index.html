<p>GraphQL HTTP is a specification for serving GraphQL over HTTP. It defines a standard way of sending GraphQL queries and mutations over the HTTP protocol, and it is widely supported by GraphQL servers and clients.</p>
<p>The GraphQL HTTP specification defines two main HTTP methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>POST:</strong> Used to send queries and mutations to the server. The query or mutation is sent in the request body as a JSON payload, and the server returns the result in the response body.</li>
<li><strong>GET:</strong> Used to send queries to the server, but it’s not recommended to use GET for queries because it’s not as efficient as POST method.</li>
</ul>
