<p>Authorization in GraphQL refers to the process of controlling access to specific fields, types, or operations in a GraphQL schema based on user roles or permissions. It allows you to restrict access to certain data or functionality in your application based on the userâ€™s role or permissions.</p>
<p>There are several ways to implement authorization in GraphQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using middleware</li>
<li>Using schema directives</li>
<li>Using a data source layer</li>
</ul>
