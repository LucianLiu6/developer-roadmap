<p>Serving GraphQL over the internet refers to the process of making a GraphQL server available to clients over the internet, typically by exposing the serverâ€™s endpoint through a public IP address or a domain name.</p>
<p>There are several ways to serve a GraphQL server over the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a reverse proxy</li>
<li>Using a cloud service</li>
<li>Using a serverless function</li>
</ul>
