<p>Caching is a technique that is used to improve the performance of a GraphQL server by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the data source. It works by storing a copy of the data that has been requested by a client in a cache, and then returning that data from the cache instead of the data source when the same data is requested again.</p>
<p>There are several types of caching that can be used in GraphQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-side caching</li>
<li>Server-side caching</li>
<li>CDN caching</li>
</ul>
