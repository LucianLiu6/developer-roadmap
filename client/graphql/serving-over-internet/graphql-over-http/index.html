<p>GraphQL over HTTP refers to the ability to send GraphQL queries and mutations over the HTTP protocol. This allows clients to interact with a GraphQL server using the same standard HTTP methods and headers that are used for other types of web requests.</p>
<p>The most common way to send GraphQL queries and mutations over HTTP is by using the <strong>POST</strong> method, where the query or mutation is sent in the request body as a JSON payload. The server will then execute the query or mutation and return the result in the response body.</p>
