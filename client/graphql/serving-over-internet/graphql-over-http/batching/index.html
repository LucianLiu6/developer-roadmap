<p>Batching in GraphQL refers to the process of sending multiple queries or mutations in a single request. This allows the client to reduce the number of round trips to the server, and can improve the performance of the application.</p>
<p>There are several ways to implement batching in GraphQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a batching library: This approach involves using a library such as apollo-link-batch-http, which provides a way to batch multiple queries or mutations into a single request.</li>
<li>Using a middleware: This approach involves using a middleware such as graphql-batch, which allows you to batch multiple queries or mutations into a single request.</li>
<li>Using a serverless function: This approach involves using a serverless function such as AWS Lambda, which allows you to batch multiple queries or mutations into a single request.</li>
</ul>
