<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs. It provides a simple and flexible syntax for making requests to a server to retrieve specific data. In GraphQL, a query is a request made to the server to fetch data. The query specifies the fields of the data that should be returned, and the server responds with the requested data.</p>
<p>A GraphQL query is structured as a single object, with a “query” or “mutation” field at the top level. The “query” field is used to retrieve data, while the “mutation” field is used to make changes to the data. The query is written in a specific format and is executed by the server to retrieve the requested data.</p>
