<p>In GraphQL, scalar coercion is the process of converting a value from one type to another, as it flows through the resolvers. This is needed when the input value for a field does not match the expected type, but can still be successfully converted to the correct type.</p>
<p>Scalar coercion can be implemented in the resolvers by using the <strong>GraphQLScalarType</strong> constructor to define a custom scalar type and providing a <strong>coerce</strong> function that can convert the input value to the correct type.</p>
