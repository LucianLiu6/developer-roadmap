<p>In GraphQL, an object is a type that represents a group of fields. Objects can be used to define the structure of a query or a mutation. Each field of an object can return a scalar value (such as a string or an integer) or another object, allowing for the creation of complex, nested data structures. In a GraphQL schema, objects are defined using the <strong>type</strong> keyword, followed by the objectâ€™s name and a set of fields in curly braces.</p>
