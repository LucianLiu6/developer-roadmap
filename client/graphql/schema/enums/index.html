<p>Enums also called as enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a particular set of allowed values. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate that any arguments of this type are one of the allowed values</li>
<li>Communicate through the type system that a field will always be one of a finite set of values</li>
</ul>
