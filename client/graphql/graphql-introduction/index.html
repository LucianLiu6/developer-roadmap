<p>GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. It is used to build and consume web service APIs.</p>
<p>GraphQL allows clients to make a single API call to request exactly the data they need, in a predictable format. This allows for more efficient and flexible data retrieval, compared to traditional REST APIs where the client has to make multiple API calls to different endpoints, and may receive more data than it needs.</p>
<p>With GraphQL, the client defines the structure of the data it needs, by sending a query to the server. The server then returns the requested data in the same structure, as defined by the query. The client can also make mutations to update or create data on the server.</p>
