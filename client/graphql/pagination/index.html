<p>Pagination in GraphQL refers to the process of breaking up large sets of data into smaller chunks, also known as pages, and providing a way to navigate between these pages. This allows clients to retrieve a specific subset of data, rather than having to retrieve all of the data at once, which can be beneficial for performance, especially when working with large datasets.</p>
<p>There are several ways to implement pagination in GraphQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cursor-based pagination</li>
<li>Offset-based pagination</li>
<li>Relay-style pagination</li>
</ul>
