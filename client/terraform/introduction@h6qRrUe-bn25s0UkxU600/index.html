<p>Terraform is a powerful tool designed by HashiCorp that helps you set up, manage, and update infrastructure safely and efficiently across various cloud providers. Think of it as a way to define your cloud resources—like servers, storage, and networks—using a simple code format. This makes it easier to automate, share, and manage your infrastructure, ensuring that everything is consistent and can be quickly reproduced or modified as needed.</p>
