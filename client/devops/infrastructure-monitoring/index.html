<p>Monitoring refers to the practice of making the performance and status of infrastructure visible. This section contains common tools used for monitoring.</p>
<p>This is a very vendor-heavy space - use caution when studying materials exclusively from a given product or project, as there are many conflicting opinions and strategies in use.
