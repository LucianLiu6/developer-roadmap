<p>GitOps is a methodology for managing cloud-native applications and infrastructure using Git as the source of truth. It is based on the idea that all changes to the system, whether they are related to code, configuration, or infrastructure, should be made using Git and that Git should be used to automate the deployment and management of those changes.</p>
<p>In a GitOps workflow, changes to the system are made by committing code or configuration changes to a Git repository. These changes are then automatically deployed to the production environment using a continuous delivery pipeline. The pipeline is triggered by changes to the Git repository and is responsible for building, testing, and deploying the changes to the production environment.</p>
<p>GitOps is designed to be a more efficient and agile way of managing cloud-native environments, as it allows developers to make changes to the system using familiar tools and processes and it provides a clear and auditable history of all changes to the system. It is often used in conjunction with tools such as Kubernetes and Helm to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.</p>
