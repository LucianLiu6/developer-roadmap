<p>In the context of Vue applications, a “composable” is a function that leverages Vue’s Composition API to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.</p>
<p>When building frontend applications, we often need to reuse logic for common tasks. For example, we may need to format dates in many places, so we extract a reusable function for that. This formatter function encapsulates stateless logic: it takes some input and immediately returns expected output. There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for example lodash and date-fns, which you may have heard of.</p>
