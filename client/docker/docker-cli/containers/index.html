<p>Containers can be thought of as lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, ensuring that it works uniformly across different environments.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-containers">Why Use Containers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Portability</strong>: Containers ensure that applications work consistently across different platforms, be it a developer’s laptop or a production server. This eliminates the “it works on my machine” problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Containers are lightweight since they use shared resources without the overhead of a full-fledged operating system. This enables faster startup times and reduces resource usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Containers can be effortlessly scaled up or down according to the workload, making it ideal for distributed applications and microservices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Containers enable developers, QA, and operations teams to have a consistent environment throughout the application lifecycle, leading to faster and smoother deployment pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Containers provide a level of isolation from other containers and the underlying host system, which aids in maintaining application security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-containers-using-docker-cli">Working with Containers using Docker CLI</h2>
<p>Docker CLI offers several commands to help you create, manage, and interact with containers. Some common commands include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>docker run</code>: Used to create and start a new container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>docker container ls</code>: Lists running containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>docker container stop</code>: Stops a running container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>docker container rm</code>: Removes a stopped container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>docker exec</code>: Executes a command inside a running container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>docker logs</code>: Fetches the logs of a container, useful for debugging issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
