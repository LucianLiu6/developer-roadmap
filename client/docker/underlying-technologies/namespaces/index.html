<p>Namespaces are one of the core technologies that Docker uses to provide isolation between containers. In this section, we’ll briefly discuss what namespaces are and how they work.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-namespaces">What are Namespaces?</h3>
<p>In the Linux kernel, namespaces are a feature that allows the isolation of various system resources, making it possible for a process and its children to have a view of a subset of the system that is separate from other processes. Namespaces help to create an abstraction layer to keep containerized processes separate from one another and from the host system.</p>
<p>There are several types of namespaces in Linux, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PID (Process IDs)</strong>: Isolates the process ID number space, which means that processes within a container only see their own processes, not those on the host or in other containers.</li>
<li><strong>Network (NET)</strong>: Provides each container with a separate view of the network stack, including its own network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules.</li>
<li><strong>Mount (MNT)</strong>: Isolates the file system mount points in such a way that each container has its own root file system, and mounted resources appear only within that container.</li>
<li><strong>UTS (UNIX Time Sharing System)</strong>: Allows each container to have its own hostname and domain name, separate from other containers and the host system.</li>
<li><strong>User (USER)</strong>: Maps user and group identifiers between the container and the host, so different permissions can be set for resources within the container.</li>
<li><strong>IPC (Inter-Process Communication)</strong>: Allows or restricts the communication between processes in different containers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-docker-uses-namespaces">How Docker uses Namespaces</h3>
<p>Docker uses namespaces to create isolated environments for containers. When a container is started, Docker creates a new set of namespaces for that container. These namespaces only apply within the container, so any processes running inside the container have access to a subset of system resources that are isolated from other containers as well as the host system.</p>
<p>By leveraging namespaces, Docker ensures that containers are truly portable and can run on any system without conflicts or interference from other processes or containers running on the same host.</p>
<p>In summary, namespaces provide a level of resource isolation that enables running multiple containers with separate system resources within the same host, without them interfering with each other. This is a critical feature that forms the backbone of Docker’s container technology.</p>
