<p>In the ASP.NET Core framework, filters and attributes are used to add additional functionality to controllers and action methods, such as authentication, authorization, caching, and exception handling.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Filters</strong> are classes that implement one or more of the filter interfaces provided by the framework, such as <code>IActionFilter</code>, <code>IResultFilter</code>, <code>IExceptionFilter</code>, and <code>IAuthorizationFilter</code>. Filters can be applied to controllers, action methods, or globally to the entire application. They can be used to perform tasks such as logging, caching, and handling exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong> are classes that derive from <code>Attribute</code> class, and are used to decorate controllers, action methods, or properties with additional metadata. For example, the Authorize attribute can be used to require that a user is authenticated before accessing a specific action method, and the <code>ValidateAntiForgeryToken</code> attribute can be used to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</p>
