<p>Object mapping in ASP.NET refers to the process of converting an object of one type to an object of another type. This can be useful in a number of scenarios, such as when working with domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs) in a layered architecture, or when mapping between different versions of an object or different formats such as JSON and XML.</p>
<p>There are several libraries available for object mapping in ASP.NET, such as AutoMapper, ExpressMapper, AgileMapper, AgileMapster and Mapster. These libraries provide a convenient and flexible way to map between objects, using a convention-based approach or a fluent API to configure more complex mappings. They also support for a wide range of mapping scenarios, including nested and circular object graphs, collections, and different types of inheritance.</p>
