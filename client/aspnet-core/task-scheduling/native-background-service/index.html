<p>A Native Background Service in ASP.NET is a type of service that can run in the background on a device, without the need for an active user session. These services are typically used for tasks that need to run continuously, such as sending notifications, polling for updates, or processing data.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET, a Native Background Service can be implemented using the IHostedService interface, which is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting namespace. This interface allows you to create a background service that can run continuously, even when the main application is not running.</p>
