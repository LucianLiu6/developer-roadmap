<p>Quartz is an open-source, job scheduling library for .NET that can be used in ASP.NET applications. It is based on the popular Quartz scheduler for Java, and provides a similar feature set for scheduling and executing background jobs in .NET applications.</p>
<p>With Quartz, you can schedule jobs to run at specific times or intervals, and you can also set up triggers to start a job based on certain events. Quartz also provides a rich set of options for configuring and managing your jobs, such as pausing, resuming, and canceling jobs, as well as job chaining and priorities.</p>
