<p>Coravel is an open-source, lightweight library for .NET that allows you to easily perform background processing and scheduling in your ASP.NET Core application. It provides a simple and elegant way to schedule tasks, run background jobs, and manage queues in your application.</p>
<p>Coravel is inspired by Laravel’s task scheduler and it’s built on top of the .NET Core built-in Dependency Injection. It uses a fluent API to schedule tasks, allowing you to easily specify the frequency, start time, and end time of the task. It also provides a simple way to queue and process background jobs, allowing you to easily process large amounts of data or perform long-running tasks.</p>
