<p>Hangfire is an open-source, lightweight library for .NET that allows you to easily perform background processing in your ASP.NET application. It provides a simple and elegant way to run background jobs, schedule future tasks, and monitor the progress of your background jobs.</p>
<p>Hangfire uses a storage backend, such as SQL Server or Redis, to persist the state of your background jobs. This allows you to easily scale your background processing and to monitor and manage your background jobs, even if your application restarts or crashes.</p>
