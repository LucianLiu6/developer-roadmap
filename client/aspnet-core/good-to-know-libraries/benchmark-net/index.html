<p>BenchmarkDotNet is an open-source library for .NET that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for benchmarking the performance of code. It allows you to measure the performance of methods, classes, and entire assemblies, and provides a rich set of features for analyzing and comparing the results. It provides a wide range of performance metrics, such as CPU cycles, memory allocation, and garbage collection, and can generate detailed reports that include charts, tables, and source code highlighting. It has support for multithreading and a built-in support for .NET Core.</p>
