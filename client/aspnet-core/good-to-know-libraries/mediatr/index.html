<p>MediatR is an open-source library for .NET that is designed to simplify the process of handling messages and commands in a clean, decoupled manner. Itâ€™s particularly useful in applications that use the Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern and event-driven architecture. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for handling messages, and supports the concept of pipelines, which allow you to add additional behavior to message handling, such as logging, validation, and exception handling.</p>
