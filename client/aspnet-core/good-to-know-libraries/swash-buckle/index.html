<p>Swashbuckle is an open-source library for .NET that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for generating Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation for web APIs. It automatically generates a Swagger specification for your API based on your existing .NET code, and provides a set of tools for customizing and displaying the documentation in a user-friendly format. It can be easily integrated into an ASP.NET Core web application and has a built-in web UI for developers and users to interact with the API and test its functionality. It also supports some of the advanced features like Authentication, Authorization, and more.</p>
