<p>Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.</p>
<p>In an ASP.NET application, Redis can be used as a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data in memory, rather than reading it from a slower storage system like a traditional relational database. This can greatly improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of database queries and the amount of data that needs to be read from disk.</p>
