<p>Integration testing in ASP.NET refers to the process of testing how different components or modules of a web application interact with each other. This type of testing is done to ensure that the different parts of the application are working together correctly and that the application as a whole is functioning properly. Integration testing typically involves testing the interactions between different layers of the application, such as the data access layer, the business logic layer, and the presentation layer. It can also involve testing the interactions between the web application and external systems, such as databases, web services, and other external APIs. Integration testing can be done using a variety of testing frameworks and tools, such as xUnit, NUnit, MSTest, and others. These frameworks provide the ability to create test cases that simulate different scenarios and test the applicationâ€™s behavior under different conditions.</p>
