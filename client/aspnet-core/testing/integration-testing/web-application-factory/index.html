<p>Web Application Factory (WAF) is a built-in feature of the ASP.NET Core framework that allows developers to create and configure a web application in a programmatic way. It provides a simple and flexible way to set up a web application for testing, without the need for a web server or a browser. The WAF can be used to create a test server that can be used to run integration tests or end-to-end tests for an ASP.NET Core web application, this allows developers to test the web application in a realistic environment, without the need for a physical web server or a browser. The WAF can be configured to use different services, middleware, and settings, depending on the needs of the application, this allows developers to easily set up a web application that is configured specifically for testing. The WAF also allows developers to test the web application against different configurations, such as different databases, different authentication providers, and different hosting environments.</p>
