<p>Testing in ASP.NET is the process of evaluating the performance, functionality, and overall correctness of an application developed using the ASP.NET framework. There are several types of testing that can be performed on an ASP.NET application, including unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing and E2E testing. Each type of testing has a different focus and is used at a different stage of the development process. Common testing frameworks for ASP.NET include MSTest, XUnit, NUnit, Selenium, Playwright, Puppeteer, Cypress, Specflow, Cucumber, and LightBDD.</p>
