<p>Cypress is an open-source end-to-end testing framework for web applications, it’s built on top of JavaScript and provides a set of APIs that allows developers to automate browser interactions. It’s commonly used for testing web applications, as it can be used to automate browser-based tests and assert that the application behaves as expected. Cypress for .NET is not built on top of the .NET Core runtime and it does not provide bindings for C# or any other .NET languages, it’s built on top of JavaScript and can be run in the browser.</p>
