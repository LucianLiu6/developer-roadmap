<p>Dependency injection (DI) is a software design pattern that is used to manage the dependencies of an application. It is a technique that allows developers to write loosely-coupled code, by separating the responsibility of creating and managing objects from the objects themselves.</p>
<p>In a typical implementation, a DI container is used to manage the dependencies of the application. The container is responsible for creating and managing instances of objects and their dependencies, and providing them to other objects as needed.</p>
<p>There are different types of dependency injection, such as Constructor injection, Property injection, and Method injection, which can be used depending on the requirement and the design of the application.
