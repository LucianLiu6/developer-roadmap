<p>In ASP.NET, dependency injection (DI) lifecycles determine the lifetime of objects that are resolved through the DI container. There are several predefined lifecycle options in the <code>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</code> library, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transient:</strong> A new instance of the object is created every time it is requested.</li>
<li><strong>Scoped:</strong> A new instance of the object is created for each request within the same scope.</li>
<li><strong>Singleton:</strong> A single instance of the object is created and shared across the entire application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can also create a custom lifecycle by implementing the <code>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceScopeFactory</code> interface</p>
