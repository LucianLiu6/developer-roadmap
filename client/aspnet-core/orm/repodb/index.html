<p>RepoDB is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for .NET that simplifies the process of working with databases. It is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use library that provides a simple and consistent API for performing common database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.</p>
<p>RepoDb is built on top of ADO.NET, which is the native data access technology in .NET, and provides a higher-level abstraction on top of it. This allows RepoDb to take advantage of the performance and scalability of ADO.NET while providing a simpler and more convenient API for developers.</p>
