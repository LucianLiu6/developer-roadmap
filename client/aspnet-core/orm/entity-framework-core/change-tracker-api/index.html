<p>The Change Tracker API is a feature of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks, such as Entity Framework Core, that allows developers to track changes to entities and automatically persist them to the database.</p>
<p>The Change Tracker API is typically exposed through the context class, which is the main class that manages the connection to the database and provides access to the entities.</p>
<p>When an entity is retrieved from the database, the Change Tracker API marks it as “unchanged”. When a property of the entity is modified, the Change Tracker API marks the entity as “modified”. And when a new entity is added to the context, the Change Tracker API marks it as “added”.
