<p>ActiveMQ is an open-source message broker written in Java that implements the Java Message Service (JMS) API. It can be used to send and receive messages between different applications in a loosely coupled, asynchronous manner. ActiveMQ supports a variety of messaging protocols, including JMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and OpenWire.</p>
<p>In the context of an ASP.NET application, ActiveMQ can be used to send and receive messages to and from other systems. For example, it can be used to send messages from a web application to a background service, or to send messages between different microservices.</p>
