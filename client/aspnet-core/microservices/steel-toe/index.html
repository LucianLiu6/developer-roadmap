<p>Steeltoe is an open-source project that provides a set of libraries for building cloud-native applications on the .NET platform. The libraries are designed to work with the .NET Core runtime and provide a set of abstractions for common cloud-native patterns, such as service discovery, configuration management, and circuit breaking. The goal of Steeltoe is to make it easy for developers to take advantage of the cloud-native capabilities of the .NET platform and build resilient and scalable applications.</p>
