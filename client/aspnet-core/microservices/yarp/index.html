<p>YARP is a library to help create reverse proxy servers that are high-performance, production-ready, and highly customizable. YARP is built on .NET using the infrastructure from ASP.NET and .NET (.NET 6 and newer). The key differentiator for YARP is that itâ€™s been designed to be easily customized and tweaked via .NET code to match the specific needs of each deployment scenario. YARP is designed with customizability as a primary scenario rather than requiring you to break out to script or rebuild the library from source.</p>
