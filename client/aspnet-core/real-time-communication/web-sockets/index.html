<p>WebSockets is a protocol that allows for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server. It is based on the same principle as HTTP, but it uses a different protocol to establish and maintain a connection between the client and the server. Once a connection is established, WebSockets enables the client and server to send messages to each other in real-time.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET, WebSockets can be used to create real-time, highly interactive web applications. The ASP.NET Core framework provides built-in support for WebSockets through the Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebSockets package. This package provides a set of classes and methods that make it easy to create and manage WebSockets connections.</p>
