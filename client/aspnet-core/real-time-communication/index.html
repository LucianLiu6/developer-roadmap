<p>Real-time communication in ASP.NET refers to the ability to send and receive data between a client and a server in real-time, typically with low latency. It allows the server to push updates to the client as they happen, instead of the client having to continuously poll the server for updates.</p>
<p>There are several technologies and libraries available for implementing real-time communication in ASP.NET, such as WebSockets, SignalR, gRPC, and more.</p>
