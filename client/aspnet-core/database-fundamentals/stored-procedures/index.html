<p>A stored procedure is a pre-compiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed on a database server. Stored procedures are typically used to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving data from a database, inserting or updating data, or performing complex calculations. They are stored on the database server and can be called or executed from a client application or other stored procedures. Stored procedures can improve database performance by reducing the amount of SQL code needed to be executed and allowing developers to reuse common pieces of code. They can also provide security by allowing database administrators to control which users have access to specific stored procedures.</p>
