<p>Datadog is a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform that helps organizations to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their applications and infrastructure. It provides a wide range of features including real-time monitoring, log management, tracing, and alerting, and it can be integrated with a variety of platforms, including .NET and ASP.NET.</p>
<p>In an ASP.NET application, Datadog can be used to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of the application. Datadog provides an SDK, called Datadog.Trace, which can be integrated with an ASP.NET application to automatically collect and report performance data. The SDK can be configured to report data such as request and response times, error rates, and custom metrics.</p>
