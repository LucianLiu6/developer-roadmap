<p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. It is a popular practice among software development teams, as it helps to ensure that code changes are integrated, tested, and deployed quickly and reliably.</p>
<p>In the context of ASP.NET, CI/CD can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of ASP.NET applications. For example, you can use CI/CD to automatically build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.</p>
