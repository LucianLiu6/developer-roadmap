<p>Travis CI is a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It is a popular platform that supports a wide range of languages and frameworks, including ASP.NET.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET, Travis CI can be used to automate various tasks related to the development, testing, and deployment of ASP.NET applications. For example, you can use Travis CI to automatically build, test, and deploy an ASP.NET application to a hosting provider, such as Azure or AWS, every time you push code to your source control repository.</p>
