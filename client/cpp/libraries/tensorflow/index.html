<p>TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team. It is designed for building, training, and deploying deep learning models. TensorFlow provides a set of tools for ML, deep learning, and numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow can process computations on GPUs and TPUs, which speed up training time and ensures efficient model deployment.</p>
