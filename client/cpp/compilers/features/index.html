<p>Different C++ compilers have different features. Some of the most common features of C++ compilers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Compilers can optimize the code to improve the performance of the program. For example, they can remove redundant code, inline functions, and perform loop unrolling.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Compilers can generate debugging information that can be used to debug the program.</li>
<li><strong>Warnings:</strong> Compilers can generate warnings for suspicious code that may cause errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most popular C++ compilers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):</strong> GCC is a free and open-source compiler that supports many programming languages, including C++.</li>
<li><strong>Clang:</strong> Clang is a C++ compiler that is part of the LLVM project. It is designed to be compatible with GCC.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Visual C++:</strong> Microsoft Visual C++ is a C++ compiler that is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Intel C++ Compiler:</strong> Intel C++ Compiler is a C++ compiler that is part of the Intel Parallel Studio XE suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should go through the documentation of your compiler to learn more about its features.</p>
