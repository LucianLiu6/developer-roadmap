<p>Licensing is a crucial aspect of working with libraries in C++ because it determines the rights and limitations on how you can use, modify, and distribute a given library. There are various types of licenses applied to open-source libraries. Below is a brief overview of three common licenses:</p>
<h2 id="mit-license">MIT License</h2>
<p>The MIT License is a permissive license that allows users to do whatever they want with the software code. They only need to include the original copyright, license notice, and a disclaimer of warranty in their copies.</p>
<p>Example: Including the MIT License into your project can be done by simply adding the license file and a notice at the top of your source code files like:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="cpp"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">/* Copyright (C) [year] [author]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"> * SPDX-License-Identifier:    MIT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"> */</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="gnu-general-public-license-gpl">GNU General Public License (GPL)</h2>
<p>The GPL is a copyleft license that grants users the rights to use, study, share, and modify the software code. However, any changes made to the code or any software that uses GPL licensed code must also be distributed under the GPL license.</p>
<p>Example: To include a GPL license in your project, include a <code>COPYING</code> file with the full text of the license and place a notice in your source code files like:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="cpp"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">/* Copyright (C) [year] [author]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"> * SPDX-License-Identifier:    GPL-3.0-or-later</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"> */</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="apache-license-20">Apache License 2.0</h2>
<p>The Apache License is a permissive license similar to the MIT license and allows users to do virtually anything with the software code. The primary difference is that it requires that any changes to the code are documented, and it provides specific terms for patent protection.</p>
<p>Example: To include the Apache License in your project, add a <code>LICENSE</code> file with the full text of the license. Add a notice to your source code files like:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="cpp"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">/* Copyright (C) [year] [author]</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"> * SPDX-License-Identifier:    Apache-2.0</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"> */</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>Please note that these are brief summaries of the licenses, and there are many other licenses available for use in software projects. When using third-party libraries, it is crucial to understand and adhere to the terms of their respective licenses to avoid legal complications.</p>
