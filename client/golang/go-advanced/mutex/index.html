<p>Go allows us to run code concurrently using goroutines. However, when concurrent processes access the same piece of data, it can lead to <a href="https://www.sohamkamani.com/golang/data-races/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">race conditions</a>. Mutexes are data structures provided by the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/sync/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sync</a> package. They can help us place a lock on different sections of data so that only one goroutine can access it at a time.</p>
