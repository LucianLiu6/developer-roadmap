<p><strong>Board Games</strong> represent a type of tabletop game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or “board”, according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance, and others are purely chance, with no element of skill. Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters, winning position, or accruement of points. With the digitalization of board games, developers use various <strong>Game APIs</strong> to create engaging and interactive board game experiences. An API defines a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with different software applications. Game APIs allow developers to integrate with game-specific features like game mechanics, player statistics, achievements, and more.</p>
