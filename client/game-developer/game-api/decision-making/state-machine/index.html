<p>A <strong>State Machine</strong> is a conceptual model that is frequently used in game development to manage game states, or conditions. It consists of a number of different ‘states’, or modes, and the transitions between them. For instance, a mobile game could have states such as ‘Start Screen’, ‘Playing’, ‘Paused’ and ‘Game Over’. Each one of these states will have specific commands associated and rules for transitioning to other states. This will govern the flow and behavior of the game. It can be used in AI character behaviors, UI systems, or game-level states. State Machines keep the code organised and manageable, making it easier for developers to implement complex game logic.</p>
