<p>Computer animation refers to the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. Increasingly, it’s becoming a critical component in the game development industry. Essentially, it’s divided into two categories, 2D animation and 3D animation. 2D animation, also referred to as vector animation, involves creation of images in a two-dimensional environment, including morphing, twining, and onion skinning. On the other hand, 3D animation, also known as CGI, involves moving objects and characters in a three-dimensional space. The animation process typically involves the creation of a mathematical representation of a three-dimensional object. This object is then manipulated within a virtual space by an animator to create the final animation. Software like Unity, Maya, and Blender are commonly used for computer animation in game development.</p>
