<p>Shaders are a type of software used in 3D computer graphics. They are utilized to render quality visual effects by making calculations and transformations on image data. Also, a shader is responsible for determining the final color of an object. There are several types of shaders: vertex shaders, geometry shaders, pixel shaders, and compute shaders. Each of these is programmed to manipulate specific attributes of an image, such as its vertices, pixels, and overall geometry. They are essential tools for game developers aiming to produce realistic and engaging visual experiences.</p>
