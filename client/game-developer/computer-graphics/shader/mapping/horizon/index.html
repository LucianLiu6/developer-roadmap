<p>In the context of game development, “horizon” is typically referred to as the farthest point visible in a game’s terrain, map, or landscape. It’s where the sky meets the ground from the player’s perspective. The manipulation of the horizon can greatly influence the immersion and realism of a game world. For instance, developers often use techniques like “Horizon Mapping” or “SkyBox” to visually represent the horizon and far-off scenery. A detailed and well-designed horizon can add vastness into the world, even if the playable area is limited. However, the horizon also poses performance considerations, as rendering vast landscapes can lead to extensive processing demands and memory consumption. Therefore, techniques like fogging, level of detail (LOD) reduction, and horizon occlusion are often used to manage the performance.</p>
