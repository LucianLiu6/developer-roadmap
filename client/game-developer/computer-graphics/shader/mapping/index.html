<p>”Mapping” in game development, especially in the context of shaders, predominantly refers to Texture Mapping and Normal Mapping.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Texture Mapping</strong>: This is the application of a texture (an image or colour data) onto a 3D model’s surface. It’s a process of defining how a 2D surface wraps around a 3D model or the way that a flat image is stretched across a model’s surface to paint its appearance. This could be anything from the colour of objects to their roughness or reflectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normal Mapping</strong>: This is a technique used to create the illusion of complexity in the surface of a 3D model without adding any additional geometry. A Normal Map is a special kind of texture that allows the addition of surface details, such as bumps, grooves, and scratches which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry, making a low-polygon model appear as a much more complex shape.</p>
