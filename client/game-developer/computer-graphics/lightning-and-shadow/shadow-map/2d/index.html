<p>2D, or two-dimensional, refers to games or elements that are designed on a two-dimensional plane. It’s a classic method in game development and it’s primarily used for platformers, puzzles, RPGs (Role-playing Games), and arcade games. In 2D games, the graphics are typically a bit simpler since they only deal with height and width, disregarding depth. Examples of graphical assets used in 2D game development are sprites and tilemaps. For coding and physics, it uses simpler mathematics compared to 3D. Some of the popular 2D game development engines are <code>Unity 2D</code>, <code>Godot</code>, and <code>GameMaker Studio 2</code>. These engines simplify the process of developing 2D games, providing tools and features such as 2D physics, sprite manipulation, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) pathfinding specific for two-dimensions.</p>
