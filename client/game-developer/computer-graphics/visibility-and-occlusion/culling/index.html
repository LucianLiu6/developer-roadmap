<p><strong>Culling</strong> is a performance optimization strategy employed in game development to improve efficiency and speed. <em>Culling</em> helps in reducing the rendering workload by eliminating the elements that are not visible to the player or are outside the viewport of the game. There are several types of culling, two main being; <strong>frustum culling</strong> and <strong>occlusion culling</strong>. Frustum culling involves eliminating objects that are outside of the camera’s field of view. On the other hand, Occlusion culling discards objects that are hidden or blocked by other objects. Culling ensures that only the elements that are necessary or add value to the player’s experience are processed.</p>
