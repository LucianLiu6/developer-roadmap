<p>The <strong>Graphics Pipeline</strong>, also often referred to as the rendering pipeline, is a sequence of steps that a graphics system follows to convert a 3D model into a 2D image or view that can be displayed onto a screen. These steps typically include transformation, clipping, lighting, rasterization, shading, and other processes. Each step in the pipeline represents an operation that prepares or manipulates data to be used in downstream stages. The pipeline begins with a high-level description of a scene and ends with the final image rendered onto the screen. It is a primary concept in computer graphics that developers should learn as it can help in efficient rendering and high-quality visualization.</p>
