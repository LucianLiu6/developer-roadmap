<p><strong>HLSL</strong> stands for High-Level Shader Language, and it is the proprietary shading language developed by Microsoft for use with the Microsoft Direct3D API. Just like its counterpart from OpenGL - GLSL, it opens up the power of programmable GPUs for developers by providing capability for creating customized rendering effects or performing operations that are computationally expensive in CPU. HLSL resembles the C programming language, thereby making it easier for developers coming from traditional programming backgrounds. It is often considered an integral part of the Direct X ecosystem and is used for developing complex and visually impressive graphics for games.</p>
