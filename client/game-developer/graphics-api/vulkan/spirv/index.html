<p><code>SPIR-V</code> is a binary intermediate language for graphics and computation kernels, which is defined by the Khronos Group. This programming language has been largely adopted and used by Vulkan, a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and computing API. Vulkan consumes <code>SPIR-V</code> directly, serving as the final shader stage before the GPU. The <code>SPIR-V</code> binary format is designed for portability and flexibility, allowing it to be a powerful tool for developers because of its extensibility through the addition of new instructions, without the need to rebuild toolchains or shaders. This makes <code>SPIR-V</code> an essential part of Vulkan, especially for game developers creating large, diverse worldscapes and intricate graphics.</p>
