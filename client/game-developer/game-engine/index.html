<p>A <em>Game Engine</em> is a software framework designed to facilitate the creation and development of video games. Developers use them to create games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine (“renderer”) for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, and a scene graph. Game Engines can save a significant amount of development time by providing these reusable components. However, they aren’t one-size-fits-all solutions, as developers must still customize much of the code to fit their games’ unique needs. Some popular game engines are Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot.</p>
