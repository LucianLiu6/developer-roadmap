<p>In game development, <strong>Perspective</strong> plays a significant role in creating a three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional space. It mimics the way our eyes perceive distance and depth, with objects appearing smaller as they go farther away. Essentially, this is achieved by projecting 3D co-ordinates on a virtual screen. Perspective projection is done in two types - one-point where only one axis displays a change in size with depth and two-point where both axis display a change. It creates more realistic views, enhancing game visualization and immersion. An important aspect is the playerâ€™s viewpoint, which is the vanishing point where parallel lines converge in the distance.</p>
