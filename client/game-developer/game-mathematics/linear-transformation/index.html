<p><code>Linear transformations</code> or <code>linear maps</code> are an important concept in mathematics, particularly in the fields of linear algebra and functional analysis. A linear transformation can be thought of as a transformation that preserves the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, a transformation T is linear if for every pair of vectors <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, the equation T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) holds true. Similarly, for any scalar <code>c</code> and any vector <code>x</code>, the equation T(cx)=cT(x) should also hold true. This property makes them very useful when dealing with systems of linear equations, matrices, and in many areas of computer graphics, including game development.</p>
