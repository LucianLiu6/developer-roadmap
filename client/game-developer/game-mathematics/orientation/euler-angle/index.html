<p>The <strong>Euler angle</strong> is a concept in mathematics and physics used to describe the orientation of a rigid body or a coordinate system in 3D space. It uses three angles, typically named as alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ), and represents three sequential rotations around the axes of the original coordinate system. Euler angles can represent any rotation as a sequence of three elementary rotations. Keep in mind, however, that Euler angles are not unique, and different sequences of rotations can represent identical total effects. It’s also noteworthy that Euler angles are prone to a problem known as gimbal lock, where the first and third axis align, causing a loss of a degree of freedom, and unpredictable behavior in particular orientations.</p>
