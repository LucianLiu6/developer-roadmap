<p>In game development, <strong>Restitution</strong> is a property closely related to the physics of objects. Essentially, restitution represents the “bounciness” of an object or, in more scientific terms, the ratio of the final relative velocity to the initial relative velocity of two objects after a collision. In the context of game physics, when objects collide, restitution is used to calculate how much each object should bounce back or recoil. Restitution values typically fall between 0 and 1 where a value of 0 means an object will not bounce at all and a value of 1 refers to a perfectly elastic collision with no energy lost. Therefore, the higher the restitution value, the higher the bounce back of the object after a collision.</p>
