<p>The <strong>center of mass</strong> is a position defined relative to an object or system of objects. Typically denoted by the symbol (COM), it refers to the average position of all the parts of the system, weighted according to their masses. For instance, if you have a uniformly dense object, the center of mass would be in the geometric center of that object. In gaming, the center of mass of an object can have a significant impact on how the object behaves when forces are applied to it. This includes how the object moves in response to these forces, and can affect the realism of the physics simulations in a game.</p>
