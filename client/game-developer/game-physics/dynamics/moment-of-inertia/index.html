<p>The <strong>moment of inertia</strong>, also known as rotational inertia, is a measure of an object’s resistance to changes to its rotation. In simpler terms, it’s essentially how difficult it is to start or stop an object from spinning. It is determined by both the mass of an object and its distribution of mass around the axis of rotation. In the context of game development, the moment of inertia is crucial for creating realistic movements of characters, objects or vehicles within the game. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where the motion involves spinning or revolving entities. Calculating and applying these physics ensures a more immersive and believable gaming experience.</p>
