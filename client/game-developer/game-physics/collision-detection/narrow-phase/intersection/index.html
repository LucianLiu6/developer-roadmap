<p><code>Intersection</code> is a concept in the narrow phase of game development where the exact point or points of collision are determined between two potentially colliding objects. This process takes place once a potential collision is determined in the broad phase. Algorithms such as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB), Separating Axis Theorem (SAT), Spherical or Capsule bounding, and many others are used for different intersection tests based on the shape of the objects. The intersection provides valuable data such as the point of contact, direction and depth of penetration, which are used to calculate the accurate physical response in the collision.</p>
