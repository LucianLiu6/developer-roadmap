<p><code>Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)</code> is a type of bounding volume used in computer graphics and computational geometry. It is often used to simplify complex geometric objects by correlating them as a box much closer in size and orientation to the actual object. Unlike the <code>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)</code>, the <code>OBB</code> is not constrained to align with the axis, so the box can be rotated. This orientation is usually chosen based on the objectâ€™s local coordinate system, so the <code>OBB</code> maintains its rotation. Properties of an <code>OBB</code> include its center, dimensions, and orientation. However, it is worth noting that <code>OBBs</code> can be more computationally intensive than <code>AABBs</code> due to mathematical complexity.</p>
