<p><code>Vulkan Ray Tracing</code> is an extension of the Vulkan API (Application Programming Interface), which is an open-source, cross-platform API developed by the Khronos Group. Its main goal is to provide developers with greater control over the GPU, enabling better performance and more efficient multisystem and multicore use. The Vulkan Ray Tracing extension provides a standardized ray tracing interface similar to DirectX Raytracing, enabling real-time ray tracing applications to be built on Vulkan. This extension includes a number of functionalities such as acceleration structure building and management, ray tracing shader stages and pipelines, and indirect ray tracing dispatch.</p>
