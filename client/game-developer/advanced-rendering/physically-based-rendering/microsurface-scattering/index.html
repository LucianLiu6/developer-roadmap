<p>Microsurface scattering, also known as sub-surface scattering, is an important phenomenon in Physically Based Rendering (PBR). This process involves the penetration of light into the surface of a material, where it is scattered by interacting with the material. In other words, when light strikes an object, rather than simply bouncing off the surface, some of it goes into the object and gets scattered around inside before getting re-emitted. It is key to achieving more realistic rendering of translucent materials like skin, marble, milk, and more. Consider it essential for replicating how light interacts with real-world materials in a convincing manner in your game.</p>
