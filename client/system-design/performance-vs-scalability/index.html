<p>A service is <strong>scalable</strong> if it results in increased <strong>performance</strong> in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.</p>
<p>Another way to look at performance vs scalability:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a <strong>performance</strong> problem, your system is slow for a single user.</li>
<li>If you have a <strong>scalability</strong> problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.</li>
</ul>
