<p>Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, called a cache, in order to quickly retrieve it without the need to query the original data source. This can improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of times a data source must be accessed.</p>
<p>There are several caching strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refresh Ahead</li>
<li>Write-Behind</li>
<li>Write-through</li>
<li>Cache Aside</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you can have the cache in several places, examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Caching</li>
<li>CDN Caching</li>
<li>Web Server Caching</li>
<li>Database Caching</li>
<li>Application Caching</li>
</ul>
