<p>Your database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case. Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance. it’s like having a quick-access memory for frequently used data in applications. Here’s a simplified explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Access</strong>: Imagine you’re looking up information in a big library (the database). Instead of going to the library every time you need the same book (data), you keep a copy of it on your desk (cache).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faster Retrieval</strong>: When you need that book again, you first check your desk (cache). If it’s there, great! You get it right away without going to the library (database) again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saving Time</strong>: If the book isn’t on your desk (cache miss), you go to the library (database) to get it. But you make sure to put a copy on your desk for next time, so you won’t have to go to the library again if you need it soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Different Types</strong>: There are different ways to do this caching. You can cache the results of searches (like bookmarking), whole pieces of information (like keeping a paper copy), or even entire web pages (like saving a snapshot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: By keeping frequently used data close by, you save time and reduce the strain on the library (database). It’s like having your most-used books right at your fingertips, making your work faster and more efficient.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s important to keep the cached data up to date. Otherwise, you might end up with outdated information, like using an old edition of a book instead of the latest one. So, managing this cache properly is key to keeping things running smoothly.</p>
