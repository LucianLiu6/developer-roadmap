<p>All commercial systems that include sensitive data must implement a security structure. The complexity of the security mechanism is usually a function of the sensitivity of the data. In a system that requires users to be authenticated, you should record:</p>
<ul>
<li>All sign-in attempts, whether they fail or succeed.</li>
<li>All operations performed by—and the details of all resources accessed by—an authenticated user.</li>
<li>When a user ends a session and signs out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring might be able to help detect attacks on the system. For example, a large number of failed sign-in attempts might indicate a brute-force attack. An unexpected surge in requests might be the result of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. You must be prepared to monitor all requests to all resources regardless of the source of these requests. A system that has a sign-in vulnerability might accidentally expose resources to the outside world without requiring a user to actually sign in.</p>
