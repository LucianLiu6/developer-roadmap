<p>Consistency patterns refer to the ways in which data is stored and managed in a distributed system, and how that data is made available to users and applications. There are three main types of consistency patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong consistency</li>
<li>Weak consistency</li>
<li>Eventual Consistency</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these patterns has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which pattern to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application or system.</p>
