<p>Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server. You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN. You can configure when content expires and when it is updated. Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.</p>
<p>Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isnâ€™t often updated work well with push CDNs. Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.</p>
