<p>Performing asynchronous work on a large number of background threads can starve other concurrent foreground tasks of resources, decreasing response times to unacceptable levels.</p>
<p>Resource-intensive tasks can increase the response times for user requests and cause high latency. One way to improve response times is to offload a resource-intensive task to a separate thread. This approach lets the application stay responsive while processing happens in the background. However, tasks that run on a background thread still consume resources. If there are too many of them, they can starve the threads that are handling requests.</p>
<p>This problem typically occurs when an application is developed as monolithic piece of code, with all of the business logic combined into a single tier shared with the presentation layer.</p>
