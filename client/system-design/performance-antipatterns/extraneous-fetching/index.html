<p>Extraneous fetching in system design refers to the practice of retrieving more data than is needed for a specific task or operation. This can occur when a system is not optimized for the specific workload or when the system is not properly designed to handle the data requirements.</p>
<p>Extraneous fetching can lead to a number of issues, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance degradation</li>
<li>Increased resource utilization</li>
<li>Increased network traffic</li>
<li>Poor user experience</li>
</ul>
