<p>No caching antipattern occurs when a cloud application that handles many concurrent requests, repeatedly fetches the same data. This can reduce performance and scalability.</p>
<p>When data is not cached, it can cause a number of undesirable behaviors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeatedly fetching the same information from a resource that is expensive to access, in terms of I/O overhead or latency.</li>
<li>Repeatedly constructing the same objects or data structures for multiple requests.</li>
<li>Making excessive calls to a remote service that has a service quota and throttles clients past a certain limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In turn, these problems can lead to poor response times, increased contention in the data store, and poor scalability.</p>
