<p>Performance antipatterns in system design refer to common mistakes or suboptimal practices that can lead to poor performance in a system. These patterns can occur at different levels of the system and can be caused by a variety of factors such as poor design, lack of optimization, or lack of understanding of the workload.</p>
<p>Some of the examples of performance antipatterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>N+1 queries:</strong> This occurs when a system makes multiple queries to a database to retrieve related data, instead of using a single query to retrieve all the necessary data.</li>
<li><strong>Chatty interfaces:</strong> This occurs when a system makes too many small and frequent requests to an external service or API, instead of making fewer, larger requests.</li>
<li><strong>Unbounded data:</strong> This occurs when a system retrieves or processes more data than is necessary for the task at hand, leading to increased resource usage and reduced performance.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficient algorithms:</strong> This occurs when a system uses an algorithm that is not well suited to the task at hand, leading to increased resource usage and reduced performance.</li>
</ul>
