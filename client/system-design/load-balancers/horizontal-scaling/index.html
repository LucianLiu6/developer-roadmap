<p>Load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability. Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling. It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-horizontal-scaling">Disadvantages of horizontal scaling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers
<ul>
<li>Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures</li>
<li>Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out.</li>
</ul>
