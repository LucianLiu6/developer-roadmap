<p>Route requests to multiple services or multiple service instances using a single endpoint. The pattern is useful when you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose multiple services on a single endpoint and route to the appropriate service based on the request</li>
<li>Expose multiple instances of the same service on a single endpoint for load balancing or availability purposes</li>
<li>Expose differing versions of the same service on a single endpoint and route traffic across the different versions</li>
</ul>
