<p>Create helper services that send network requests on behalf of a consumer service or application. An ambassador service can be thought of as an out-of-process proxy that is co-located with the client.</p>
<p>This pattern can be useful for offloading common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing, security (such as TLS), and resiliency patterns in a language agnostic way. It is often used with legacy applications, or other applications that are difficult to modify, in order to extend their networking capabilities. It can also enable a specialized team to implement those features.</p>
