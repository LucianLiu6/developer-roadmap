<p>SQL databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, are best suited for structured, relational data and use a fixed schema. They provide robust ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions and support complex queries and joins.</p>
<p>NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Cassandra, are best suited for unstructured, non-relational data and use a flexible schema. They provide high scalability and performance for large amounts of data and are often used in big data and real-time web applications.</p>
<p>The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific use case and requirements of the project. If you need to store and query structured data with complex relationships, an SQL database is likely a better choice. If you need to store and query large amounts of unstructured data with high scalability and performance, a NoSQL database may be a better choice.</p>
