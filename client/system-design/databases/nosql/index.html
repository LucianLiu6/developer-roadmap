<p>NoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a key-value store, document store, wide column store, or a graph database. Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code. Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.</p>
<p>BASE is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases. In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses availability over consistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically available - the system guarantees availability.</li>
<li>Soft state - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.</li>
<li>Eventual consistency - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesnâ€™t receive input during that period.</li>
</ul>
