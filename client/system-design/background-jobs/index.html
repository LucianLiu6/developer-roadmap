<p>Background jobs in system design refer to tasks that are executed in the background, independently of the main execution flow of the system. These tasks are typically initiated by the system itself, rather than by a user or another external agent.</p>
<p>Background jobs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing maintenance tasks: such as cleaning up old data, generating reports, or backing up the database.</li>
<li>Processing large volumes of data: such as data import, data export, or data transformation.</li>
<li>Sending notifications or messages: such as sending email notifications or push notifications to users.</li>
<li>Performing long-running computations: such as machine learning or data analysis.</li>
</ul>
