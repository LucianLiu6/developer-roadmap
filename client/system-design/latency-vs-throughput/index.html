<p>Latency and throughput are two important measures of a systemâ€™s performance. <strong>Latency</strong> refers to the amount of time it takes for a system to respond to a request. <strong>Throughput</strong> refers to the number of requests that a system can handle at the same time.</p>
<p>Generally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.</p>
