<p>Riverpod was created by the same author as Provider, and is designed to make it easier to manage application state by providing a more intuitive API and better performance than Provider.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Riverpod is its ability to manage and scope state in a more granular way than Provider. This can make it easier to reason about your applicationâ€™s state and can lead to more efficient re-renders.</p>
