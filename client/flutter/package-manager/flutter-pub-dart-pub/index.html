<p><code>pub</code> is the package manager for Dart and Flutter, used for managing dependencies and publishing packages.</p>
<p>With <code>pub</code>, developers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for and download packages from the <code>pub.dev</code> repository.</li>
<li>Manage dependencies in their projects, including adding, updating, and removing packages.</li>
<li>Publish their own packages to <code>pub.dev</code> for others to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Flutter projects, <code>pub</code> is used to manage both Dart packages and Flutter plugins. This makes it easy to find and use packages that extend the functionality of your Flutter application.</p>
