<p>Futures in Flutter are a way of representing a potential value that will be available at some point in the future. Some key points about Futures in Flutter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Futures are used for asynchronous programming in Flutter</li>
<li>Futures return a single value (or an error) and are often used with <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>then</code> method can be used to attach a callback to a Future that will be executed once the Futureâ€™s value is available</li>
<li>Futures can be combined with other Futures using <code>Future.wait</code> or <code>Future.whenComplete</code> methods</li>
<li>Futures are often used with network requests, file I/O operations, and other long-running tasks in Flutter.</li>
</ul>
