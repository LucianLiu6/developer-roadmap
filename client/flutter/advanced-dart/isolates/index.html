<p>Isolates in Flutter are separate execution contexts that run in parallel with each other. They are used to improve performance and concurrency in Flutter applications. Key benefits of using Isolates in Flutter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Performance: Isolates allow you to run intensive computations or blocking operations in the background, without freezing the user interface.</li>
<li>Concurrent Execution: Isolates provide a way to run multiple tasks concurrently, allowing you to improve the overall performance of your app.</li>
<li>Isolation: Each Isolate runs in its own memory space and is isolated from other Isolates. This makes it easier to write reliable and secure code.</li>
<li>Communication: Flutter provides a mechanism for communicating between Isolates, allowing them to share data and coordinate their work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isolates are created using the <code>Isolate</code> class and can be used for a variety of tasks, such as network operations, long-running computations, or background tasks. When using Isolates, itâ€™s important to be mindful of the cost of context-switching and communication between Isolates.</p>
