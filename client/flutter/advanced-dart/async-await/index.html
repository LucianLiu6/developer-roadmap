<p>It is a programming pattern in Flutter that makes it easier to write asynchronous code. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>async</strong>: The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, which means that the function can run asynchronously and not block the main thread.</li>
<li><strong>await</strong>: The await keyword is used inside an async function to wait for the result of an asynchronous operation before continuing the execution of the function.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, you can write asynchronous code that is easy to read, write, and maintain.</p>
