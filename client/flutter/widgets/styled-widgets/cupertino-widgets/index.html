<p>Cupertino widgets are a set of Flutter widgets that mimic the look and feel of Appleâ€™s iOS user interface. They are designed to provide a consistent look and feel on both iOS and Android devices, and include widgets such as CupertinoButton, CupertinoAlertDialog, and CupertinoSlider. These widgets are useful for building cross-platform apps that need to conform to the iOS design aesthetic.s</p>
