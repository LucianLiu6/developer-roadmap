<p>SQLite is an open-source, lightweight relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage data. It is written in C and self-contained, meaning it does not require a separate server process or system. SQLite is commonly used in mobile applications, embedded systems, and web browsers and is also supported by many programming languages. It is a popular choice for databases because it is easy to use and does not require a lot of setup or configuration.</p>
