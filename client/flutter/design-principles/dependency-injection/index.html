<p>Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies from external sources instead of creating them internally. In Flutter, this can be useful for managing complex state, reducing coupling between components, and making testing easier.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s how to use dependency injection in Flutter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a dependency</li>
<li>Create a provider</li>
<li>Use the provider in your widget tree</li>
<li>Access the dependency in a widget</li>
</ul>
