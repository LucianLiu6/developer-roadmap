<p>In Flutter, variables are used to store values. There are two types of variables in Flutter:</p>
<ul>
<li>local variables: These are declared within a function and are only accessible within that function</li>
<li>Instance variables: They are declared within a class and are accessible throughout the entire class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variables in Flutter can store values of different data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more.</p>
