<p>Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that allows for handling changing data streams and updating the UI based on those changes. In Flutter, reactive programming can be achieved using:</p>
<ol>
<li>Streams: A sequence of asynchronous events.</li>
<li>Futures: A way to represent a single asynchronous operation.</li>
<li>BLoCs (Business Logic Components): A state management pattern that uses streams to separate business logic from UI code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reactive programming in Flutter helps create dynamic and responsive apps that can handle changing data and update the UI accordingly. The <code>StreamBuilder</code> and <code>FutureBuilder</code> widgets are commonly used in Flutter to build reactive UIs.</p>
