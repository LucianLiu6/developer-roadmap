<p>Flutter Outline is a feature in the Flutter development environment (IDE) that provides a tree-like representation of the widgets and elements in your Flutter app. It shows the hierarchy of the widgets, their relationships, and the structure of your app.</p>
<p>The Flutter Outline can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate through your code</li>
<li>Understand the widget hierarchy</li>
<li>Debug your code</li>
<li>Refactor your code</li>
</ul>
<p>The Flutter Outline is a useful tool for Flutter developers, as it provides a high-level overview of your app and makes it easier to navigate and understand the code. It can help you to write better code and debug your app more efficiently.</p>
