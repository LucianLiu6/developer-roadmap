<p>To set up a development environment for Flutter, you need to install the following software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flutter SDK: Download and install the latest version of the Flutter SDK from the official website (<a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install</a>).</li>
<li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDE of your choice.</li>
<li>Emulator or a physical device: You can use an emulator or a physical device to run and test your Flutter apps. You can use the Android emulator provided by Android Studio or use a physical Android or iOS device.</li>
<li>Git: Git is used for version control and is recommended for Flutter development. You can download and install Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Dart SDK: Dart is the programming language used by Flutter, and the Dart SDK is required to develop Flutter apps. The Dart SDK is included in the Flutter SDK.</li>
