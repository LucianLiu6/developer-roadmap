<p>To use VS Code for Flutter development, you must install the Flutter and Dart plugins for VS Code. These plugins support Flutter-specific features such as syntax highlighting, debugging, and hot reloading.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to set up VS Code for Flutter development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install VS Code from the official website: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a></li>
<li>Open VS Code and click the Extensions icon on the left-hand side of the window.</li>
<li>In the search box, type “Flutter” and press Enter. This will display a list of Flutter-related plugins.</li>
<li>Install the “Flutter” and “Dart” plugins by clicking the Install button next to each one.</li>
<li>Once the plugins are installed, you will need to restart VS Code for the changes to take effect.</li>
<li>To create a new Flutter project, click the File menu, then select New > New Project. This will open the New Project dialog box.</li>
<li>Select the Flutter application template, enter the project’s name and location and click Create. This will create a new Flutter project in the specified location.</li>
<li>To run the project, open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) and type “flutter run”. This will run the project on the default emulator or device.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! You should now be able to use VS Code for Flutter development.</p>
