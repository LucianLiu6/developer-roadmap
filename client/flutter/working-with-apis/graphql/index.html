<p>GraphQL is a query language for your API that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more. It was developed by Facebook and released as open source in 2015.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of GraphQL is that it allows the client to request specific fields on demand, rather than having the server determine what data to send in a fixed response format. This allows the client to request only the data it needs, reducing network traffic and improving the efficiency of the API.</p>
