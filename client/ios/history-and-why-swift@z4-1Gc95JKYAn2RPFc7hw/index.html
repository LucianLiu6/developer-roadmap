<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>Swift was introduced by Apple in 2014 as a modern replacement for Objective-C.</p>
<p>It was developed to address the limitations and complexities of Objective-C, providing a more powerful and user-friendly programming language.</p>
<p><strong>Why Swift?</strong></p>
<p>Swift offers improved performance, safety, and readability. It reduces common programming errors with features like optionals and type inference.</p>
<p>Swiftâ€™s concise syntax and modern language constructs enhance developer productivity, making it easier to write and maintain code. Its open-source nature also allows a wider community to contribute and improve the language.</p>
