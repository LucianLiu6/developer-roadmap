<p>Swift is designed to work seamlessly with Objective-C, allowing developers to integrate and use both languages within the same project. This interoperability enables:</p>
<p><strong>Gradual Migration:</strong> Developers can incrementally migrate their codebase from Objective-C to Swift without needing a complete rewrite.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed-Language Projects:</strong> Swift and Objective-C files can coexist, and developers can call Objective-C code from Swift and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Existing Libraries:</strong> Swift code can leverage existing Objective-C libraries and frameworks, ensuring continued use of valuable resources and tools.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging Header:</strong> A bridging header file allows Swift to interface with Objective-C code, facilitating communication between the two languages.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Swift supports dynamic libraries, ensuring compatibility with existing Objective-C runtime and APIs.</p>
