<p>Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.</p>
<p>It was the primary language used by Apple for macOS and iOS development before the introduction of Swift.</p>
<p>Objective-C enables the creation of dynamic and flexible applications by allowing objects to send messages to each other. It is known for its runtime capabilities and is often used in conjunction with Appleâ€™s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks.</p>
