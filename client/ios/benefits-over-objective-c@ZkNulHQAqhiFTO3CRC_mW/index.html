<p><strong>Safety and Reliability:</strong> Swift includes features like optionals and type inference that reduce common programming errors and crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Syntax:</strong> Swift’s concise and clean syntax improves readability and maintainability.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Swift is designed for speed and efficiency, often outperforming Objective-C in benchmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Swift can easily coexist with Objective-C, allowing for a gradual transition of codebases.</p>
<p><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) in Swift handles memory management across both procedural and object-oriented code, reducing memory leaks.</p>
<p><strong>Playgrounds:</strong> Swift’s interactive playgrounds provide a dynamic environment for testing and learning Swift code.</p>
