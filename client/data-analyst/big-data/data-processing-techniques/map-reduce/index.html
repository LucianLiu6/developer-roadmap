<p>Map Reduce is a prominent data processing technique used by Data Analysts around the world. It allows them to handle large data sets with complex, unstructured data efficiently. Map Reduce breaks down a big data problem into smaller sub-tasks (Map) and then takes those results to create an output in a more usable format (Reduce). This technique is particularly useful in conducting exploratory analysis, as well as in handling big data operations such as text processing, graph processing, or more complicated machine learning algorithms.</p>
