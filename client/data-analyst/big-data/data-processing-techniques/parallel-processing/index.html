<p>Parallel processing is an efficient form of data processing that allows Data Analysts to deal with larger volumes of data at a faster pace. It is a computational method that allows multiple tasks to be performed concurrently, instead of sequentially, thus, speeding up data processing. Parallel processing proves to be invaluable for Data Analysts, as they are often tasked with analyzing huge data sets and compiling reports in real-time. As the demand for rapid data processing and quick analytics is on the rise, the technique of parallel processing forms a critical element in the versatile toolkit of a Data Analyst.</p>
