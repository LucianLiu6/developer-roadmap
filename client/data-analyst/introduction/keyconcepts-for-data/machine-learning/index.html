<p>Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, is an indispensable tool in the hands of a data analyst. It provides the ability to automatically learn, improve from experience and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. In the context of a data analyst, machine learning contributes significantly in uncovering hidden insights, recognising patterns or making predictions based on large amounts of data. Through the use of varying algorithms and models, data analysts are able to leverage machine learning to convert raw data into meaningful information, making it a critical concept in data analysis.</p>
