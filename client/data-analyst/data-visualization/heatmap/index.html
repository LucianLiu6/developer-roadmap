<p>Heatmaps are a crucial component of data visualization that Data Analysts regularly employ in their analyses. As one of many possible graphical representations of data, heatmaps show the correlation or scale of variation between two or more variables in a dataset, making them extremely useful for pattern recognition and outlier detection. Individual values within a matrix are represented in a heatmap as colors, with differing intensities indicating the degree or strength of an occurrence. In short, a Data Analyst would use a heatmap to decode complex multivariate data and turn it into an easily understandable visual that aids in decision making.</p>
