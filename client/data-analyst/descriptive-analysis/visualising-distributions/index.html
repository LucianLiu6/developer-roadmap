<p>Visualising Distributions, from a data analyst’s perspective, plays a key role in understanding the overall distribution and identifying patterns within data. It aids in summarising, structuring, and plotting structured data graphically to provide essential insights. This includes using different chart types like bar graphs, histograms, and scatter plots for interval data, and pie or bar graphs for categorical data. Ultimately, the aim is to provide a straightforward and effective manner to comprehend the data’s characteristics and underlying structure. A data analyst uses these visualisation techniques to make initial conclusions, detect anomalies, and decide on further analysis paths.</p>
