<p>Data cleaning plays a crucial role in the data analysis pipeline, where it rectifies and enhances the quality of data to increase the efficiency and authenticity of the analytical process. The <code>dplyr</code> package, an integral part of the <code>tidyverse</code> suite in R, has become a staple in the toolkit of data analysts dealing with data cleaning. <code>dplyr</code> offers a coherent set of verbs that significantly simplifies the process of manipulating data structures, such as dataframes and databases. This involves selecting, sorting, filtering, creating or modifying variables, and aggregating records, among other operations. Incorporating <code>dplyr</code> into the data cleaning phase enables data analysts to perform operations more effectively, improve code readability, and handle large and complex data with ease.</p>
