<p>Web scraping plays a significant role in collecting unique datasets for data analysis. In the realm of a data analystâ€™s tasks, web scraping refers to the method of extracting information from websites and converting it into a structured usable format like a CSV, Excel spreadsheet, or even into databases. This technique allows data analysts to gather large sets of data from the internet, which otherwise could be time-consuming if done manually. The capability of web scraping and parsing data effectively can give data analysts a competitive edge in their data analysis process, from unlocking in-depth, insightful information to making data-driven decisions.</p>
