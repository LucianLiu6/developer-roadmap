<p>CSV or Comma Separated Values files play an integral role in data collection for data analysts. These file types allow the efficient storage of data and are commonly generated by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, but their simplicity makes them compatible with a variety of applications that deal with data. In the context of data analysis, CSV files are extensively used to import and export large datasets, making them essential for any data analystâ€™s toolkit.
