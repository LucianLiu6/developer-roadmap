<p>Understanding the minimum and maximum values in your dataset is critical in data analysis. These basic functions, often referred to as Min-Max functions, are statistical tools that data analysts use to inspect the distribution of a particular dataset. By identifying the lowest and highest values, data analysts can gain insight into the range of the dataset, identify possible outliers, and understand the dataâ€™s variability. Beyond their use in descriptive statistics, Min-Max functions also play a vital role in data normalization, shaping the accuracy of predictive models in Machine Learning and AI fields.</p>
