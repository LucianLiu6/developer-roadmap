<p>Data manipulation is a key aspect of the role of a data analyst. There are numerous data manipulation libraries available that enable data analysts to handle, process and analyze massive datasets effectively and efficiently. These libraries, particularly in programming languages like Python, R, and more, come with a wide range of functionalities that include sorting, filtering, aggregating, merging and reshaping data. Using data manipulation libraries, data analysts can transform raw data into a more understandable or usable format to derive meaningful insights or conclusions. A few examples of these libraries are Pandas in Python, dplyr in R, and DataTable in Julia. These libraries not only make data manipulation tasks easier but also contribute to improving the overall data analysis process.</p>
