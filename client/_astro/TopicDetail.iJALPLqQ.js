It involves handling user authentication, authorization, and processing user requests, typically using [backend development languages](https://roadmap.sh/backend/languages) such as Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), and .NET.

## What does a Backend Developer do?
A backend developer focuses on creating and maintaining the server-side components of web applications. They are primarily tasked with developing server-side APIs, handling database operations, and ensuring that the backend can manage high traffic volumes efficiently. Key responsibilities include integrating external services such as payment gateways and cloud services, and enhancing the performance and scalability of systems. This role is crucial for processing and securing data, serving as the backbone that supports frontend developers in delivering a seamless user experience.

DevOps is not a specific job title or role, but rather a set of practices and principles that can be applied across a variety of roles in software development and IT operations. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps practices in their work, including developers, testers, operations engineers, product managers, and others.

## What is a DevOps Engineer?
While DevOps is not a specific job title or role, organizations often hire for a "DevOps Engineer" role. A DevOps Engineer is a software engineer who specializes in the practices and tools that enable the continuous delivery of software. DevOps Engineers are responsible for the design and implementation of applications, software, and services for their organization, and they work closely with developers, testers, and operations staff to oversee the code releases.
