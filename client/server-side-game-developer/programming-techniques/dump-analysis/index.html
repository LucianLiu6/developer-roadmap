<p><strong>Dump Analysis</strong> is a highly useful technique in server-side game development, primarily used for debugging and troubleshooting. It involves studying the ‘dump’ or all the information within a system when a program crashes or fails. This dump typically includes the system’s memory, the active processes, thread stacks, and more. By analyzing this data, developers can get an insight into what caused the failure. Dump analysis can be manual, using debuggers like WinDbg, lldb, gdb, or automated with tools such as Microsoft’s Automatic Debugging Tool (ADPlus) and DebugDiag. Note that the complexity of dump analysis can vary depending on the nature of the program crash or the size of the dump.</p>
