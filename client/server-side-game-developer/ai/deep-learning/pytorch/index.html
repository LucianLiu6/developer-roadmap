<p><strong>PyTorch</strong> is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research team for Python-based computation. This powerful tool emphasizes flexibility and allows users to manipulate Tensor computations with the convenience of deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodifferentiation system. It provides a great platform for implementing deep learning models and is very popular for understanding and expressing dynamic neural networks. PyTorch supports dynamic computational graphs, which means the graph structure can be modified during runtime. This is particularly useful while working with recurrent neural networks. It integrates seamlessly with the python data science stack to leverage the power of libraries such as NumPy.</p>
