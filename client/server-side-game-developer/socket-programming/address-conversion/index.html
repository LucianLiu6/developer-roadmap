<p>In socket programming, address conversion functions are important for handling internet addresses. Functions like <code>inet_pton()</code> (presentation to network) and <code>inet_ntop()</code> (network to presentation) are frequently used. <code>inet_pton()</code> function converts an IP address in human-friendly format (IPv4 addresses in dotted-decimal notation or IPv6 addresses in hexadecimal notation) to its equivalent binary form. Conversely, <code>inet_ntop()</code> function does the reverse, i.e., it converts an IP address in binary form to human-friendly format. These functions are important tools when dealing with IP addresses in lower-level network programming.</p>
