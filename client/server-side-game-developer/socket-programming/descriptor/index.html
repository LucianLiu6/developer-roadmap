<p>In the context of socket programming, a <strong>descriptor</strong> is simply an identifier for a resource. With the use of these descriptors, socket applications can interact with system resources such as network connections, files, or data streams. For instance, in C-based languages such as C++, socket programming frequently makes use of file descriptors. These are integer values used by the operating system to identify open files and network sockets. It is crucial for a server-side game developer to understand and make efficient use of descriptors to control and manage all the network protocols, ensuring seamless game experiences.</p>
