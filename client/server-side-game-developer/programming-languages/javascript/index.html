<p>JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It plays a key role in web development as it is one of the three core languages of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and CSS. In server-side game development, JavaScript can be utilized through runtime environments such as Node.js. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved to incorporate additional features, such as support for object-oriented and functional programming styles. It is dynamically-typed, and supports event-driven programming, which is especially handy in game development for handling user inputs and system events. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java.</p>
