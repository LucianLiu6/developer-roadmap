<p><code>Memcached</code> is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system that is generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database loads. It does this by storing data and objects in dynamic memory to reduce the frequency with which an external data source must be read. <code>Memcached</code> is fundamentally a key-value store that operates over the network. It uses a clientâ€“server architecture where the servers maintain a common view of the data set. The clients are responsible for partitioning data and determining to which servers data items are to be written or from which servers they are to be read.</p>
