<p><code>Redis</code> is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, a cache, and a message broker. It provides support for various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, and more. Redis also allows atomic operations like appending to a string; increasing and decreasing hash, array and sorted sets values; computing set intersection, union and difference; and much more. An interesting feature of Redis is its ability to create transactions and also publish and subscribe to channels. It is a great choice for high-performance software like games because of its versatile nature and efficient performance.</p>
