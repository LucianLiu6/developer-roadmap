<p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with data. It is developed, marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, a Swedish company, and is written in C and C++. Since itâ€™s open-source, you can use MySQL completely free of charge. MySQL is primarily used for online transactions and for consolidating data. You can install it on various platforms like Linux, Windows, Mac OS and so on. With its comprehensive set of features like support for full-text search, cursors, triggers, stored procedures, it is powerful enough to manage even very large sets of data, making it suitable for a vast range of applications, whether they be web-based or embedded.</p>
