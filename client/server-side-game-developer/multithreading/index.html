<p>Multithreading, a specialized form of multitasking, is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) to manage multiple executions of instructions concurrently. This essentially means that multiple threads or mini-processes are executing independently yet sharing the resources of a single CPU. In programming, threads are a way to improve the application responsiveness and perform multiple operations simultaneously without requiring multiple CPUs or computers. Threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can, therefore, communicate more quickly with each other than if they were separate processes. Developers often use multithreading in server-side game development to manage complex operations with high efficiency.</p>
