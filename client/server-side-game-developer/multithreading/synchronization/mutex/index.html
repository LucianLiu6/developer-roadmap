<p><code>Mutex</code>, short for mutual exclusion, is a synchronization method used by developers to prevent multiple threads from concurrently accessing some shared resource or part of code. It is a locking mechanism that enforces limits to ensure that only one thread can perform certain operations at a time. If a <code>mutex</code> is locked by one thread, the other threads trying to lock it will be blocked until the owner thread unlocks it. This tool is essential especially in multi-threaded programming environments to avoid conditions like race conditions where the programâ€™s behavior may depend on the sequence of scheduling or timings of the threads.</p>
