<p>A <strong>semaphore</strong> is a more advanced type of synchronization tool compared to mutexes. While a mutex is either locked or unlocked, a semaphore has a count associated with it and can allow multiple threads to access a resource up to a specified count. Semaphores can be used to control access to a pool of resources, not just a singular resource like a mutex. A semaphore count represents the number of resources available. Each time a thread acquires the semaphore, the count decreases. When the count hits zero, any further threads that attempt to acquire the semaphore are blocked until the count becomes positive again. Release operation increments the count, and possibly unblocks waiting threads. The key detail is that semaphores allow multiple threads to access a resource concurrently, but with a defined maximum number of concurrent threads.</p>
