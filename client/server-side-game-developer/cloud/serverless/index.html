<p><strong>Serverless</strong> is a cloud architecture model where the application developers donâ€™t have to provision, scale, and manage servers or runtimes, to build their applications. The name serverless comes from the idea that the tasks traditionally performed by a server are handled elsewhere, abstracting the responsibility of managing servers away from the developer. Developers can write and deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A serverless model uses backends as a service (BaaS) and functions as a service (FaaS), providing automatic scaling, patching, and capacity provisioning. Popular examples of serverless providers are AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.</p>
