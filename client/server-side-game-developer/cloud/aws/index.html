<p><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> is a secure cloud services platform offered by Amazon. It provides a broad set of infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage options, networking and databases, delivered on-demand with pay-as-you-go pricing. AWS services assist server side game developers in many tasks such as storing player data, syncing games across devices, and even hosting multiplayer game servers. These services help developers scale their games to a world-wide audience without the need for up-front investments in costly hardware and infrastructure. A popular choice for start-ups and large game development companies alike, AWS has an extensive, feature-rich set of tools that allow developers to deploy, monitor and scale applications quickly.</p>
