<p>The <strong>Reactor</strong> is a design pattern that deals with synchronous I/O multiplexing. It is a part of the server side game development concept where it mainly handles service requests delivered concurrently to an application by one or more clients. The reactor allows multiple requests to be managed efficiently by the resources of a single thread. It uses an event loop and callbacks to control and manage all the different I/O streams. Often, Reactor is combined with the Proactor pattern to achieve concurrency and efficiency in utilizing system resources.</p>
