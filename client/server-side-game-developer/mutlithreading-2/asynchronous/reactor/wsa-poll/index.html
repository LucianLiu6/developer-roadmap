<p><code>WSAPoll</code> is a method utilized in server side game development, specifically within the Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock) API. <code>WSAPoll</code> is designed to determine the status of one or more sockets, allowing the application to monitor multiple sockets in a single function call. Simply put, <code>WSAPoll</code> allows sockets to reside in collections, also known as Pollfd arrays. At runtime, the status of these sockets can be checked without blocking the applicationâ€™s execution. Therefore, it is commonly used in network applications where multiple sockets need to be monitored simultaneously.</p>
