<p>The Reactive Model is an approach in server-side game development that positions the server as a responder to requests made by the client. In this model, the server is not running its own threads, but simply reacting to incoming requests from clients. It focuses on asynchronous I/O operations, meaning that the system doesn’t stall or wait for data to be written or read. When the client sends a request, the server reacts by performing a specific action, like accepting a network connection or reading data. It is built around the idea of event-driven programming, where logic is coded against events, ideally resulting in highly scalable systems. It’s often used in conjunction with non-blocking I/O models, such as Node.js or other event-driven architectures.</p>
