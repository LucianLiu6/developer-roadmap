<p>Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It organizes containers into clusters to provide a flexible, powerful foundation for distributed systems. The platform was originally developed by Google, drawing on their long experience with managing containerized applications. It groups an applicationâ€™s containers into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes offers features like automatic bin packing, horizontal scaling, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and storage orchestration, among many others. It supports a variety of underlying infrastructures, from physical servers to virtual machines and cloud-based deployments, allowing you to run your apps wherever and however you choose.</p>
