<p><code>Docker Compose</code> is a tool that allows you to define and manage multiple containers as a single entity. The containers are defined in a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file using a YAML format. This tool is primarily focused on the runtime aspects of your application such as service definitions, configuration, and connections. With <code>Docker Compose</code>, you can start, stop, and manage the entire stack of services with a single command. This makes it a very powerful tool for managing multi-container applications. It is also a good method to define a local development environment that mimics your production environment.</p>
