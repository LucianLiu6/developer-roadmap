<p>In server-side game development, <strong>routing</strong> refers to the specification of how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.). Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched. These handler functions, often coming into play within complex multiplayer game scenarios, handle the logic needed for the route, including data transmission, game state updates, etc. The use of properly configured routes ensures the correct data is sent where it is needed, supporting seamless gameplay interactions.</p>
