<p>In server-side game development, functions are a fundamental building block of programming. These are reusable pieces of code designed to perform a particular task. Developers create functions to streamline code, improve readability, and enhance the efficiency of their program. Functions can take parameters as input and return a result. The syntax for declaring a function varies from one programming language to another. However, the basic structure remains the same. It usually starts with a function keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses <code>()</code>. Inside these parentheses, we can pass parameters. These parameters are then utilized within the functionâ€™s body enclosed within curly brackets <code>{}</code>. The outputs are typically returned using a return statement. Remember, each function should ideally perform one task, and the function name should accurately represent its purpose to make the code self-explanatory.</p>
