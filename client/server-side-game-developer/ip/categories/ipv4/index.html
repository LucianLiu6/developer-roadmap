<p><code>IPv4</code>, or Internet Protocol Version 4, is the fourth version of IP (Internet Protocol). Itâ€™s a foundational protocol that routes most of the Internet traffic today, even with the growing reach of IPv6. <code>IPv4</code> is responsible for identifying devices on a network through an addressing system. The <code>IPv4</code> uses a 32-bit address schema allowing for a total of just over 4 billion addresses. Most importantly, <code>IPv4</code> determines how data is sent and received over network devices. This standard of <code>IPv4</code> helps to route data between networks and has been foundational in the creation of the modern Internet.</p>
