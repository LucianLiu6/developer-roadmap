<p><code>Protobuf</code>, or Protocol Buffers, is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. Itâ€™s both language-neutral and platform-neutral. Google designed it to be smaller and faster than XML. You design your data structures in <code>.proto</code> files, then use the Protobuf compiler <code>protoc</code> to generate data access classes in your chosen language. Google provides support for several languages including: Java, C++, Python, Objective-C, and C#. Community developed support for even more languages is also available. This gives <code>protobuf</code> a great deal of versatility, making it a popular choice for data storage and communication between services.</p>
