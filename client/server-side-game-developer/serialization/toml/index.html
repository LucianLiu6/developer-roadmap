<p><code>TOML</code>, which stands for Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language, is a configuration file format that is easy to read due to its straightforward and simple syntax. The language is designed to be unambiguous and lean, intending to make it easy for a machine to parse. It supports basic data types, such as Integer, String, Boolean, and Float, Date-Time, Array, and Table. Unlike other similar file formats, <code>TOML</code> provides a more structured hierarchy. You can use <code>TOML</code> for configuration, serialization, and other similar tasks in game development.</p>
