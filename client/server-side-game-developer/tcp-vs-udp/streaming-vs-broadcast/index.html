<p>In the context of network protocol, streaming and broadcasting are two methods for transmitting data packets. Streaming, often performed over TCP, entails sending data from one source to a single specific destination. This method is comparable to a one-to-one phone call. The streaming process is characterized by steady data transmission directly to a single receiver who has initiated a connection. On the contrary, broadcasting refers to the transmittal of data packets from one source to all possible destinations in the network. Similar to a public announcement over a loudspeaker, the data is sent to all receptive entities. Broadcasting primarily utilizes the UDP protocol and does not require a direct connection or acknowledgement of receipt from the recipients.</p>
