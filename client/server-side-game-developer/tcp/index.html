<p>TCP, an acronym for Transmission Control Protocol, is a fundamental protocol in the suite of internet protocols. It is a connection-oriented, reliable, byte stream service that sits at the transport layer of the OSI Model. In simpler terms, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange data. During this communication, TCP ensures that data is not lost or received out of order by providing error checking mechanisms and a system for retransmission of lost data. Furthermore, to ensure efficient use of network resources, TCP implements flow control, congestion control and provides a means for hosts to dynamically adjust the throughput of the connection.</p>
