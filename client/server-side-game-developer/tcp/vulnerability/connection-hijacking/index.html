<p><code>Connection hijacking</code>, also known as session hijacking, is a serious security threat in the realm of server side game development. It refers to the exploitation of a valid computer session, or more precisely, the intrusion of an unauthorized user into a valid connection between two nodes or endpoints. The attacker intercepts the traffic between these two nodes, thereby ‘hijacking’ the connection. In game development, this could involve intercepting information between a game server and a client’s system. Connection hijacking could expose sensitive data, tamper with the data in transit, or even redirect clients to rogue servers. Hence, implementing necessary security protocols to mitigate such vulnerability is crucial.</p>
