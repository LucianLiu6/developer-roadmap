<p><code>TCP</code> (Transmission Control Protocol) is an important protocol known for its reliability in delivering data packets, but it also has several vulnerabilities. The most significant weakness is TCP’s susceptibility to a variety of <strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</strong> attacks, such as TCP SYN flood attacks, where an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target’s system in an attempt to consume server resources to make the system unresponsive. Additionally, sequence prediction can be exploited where an attacker can predict the sequence number of TCP packets to hijack the TCP session. There are also risks of IP spoofing, where an attacker can forge the IP address in the TCP packet header and pretend to be another user in the network. These vulnerabilities may expose sensitive information, disrupt normal functions or allow unauthorized access, especially in the context of a server-side game developer dealing with potentially large volumes of traffic.</p>
