<p><code>UDP</code>, or User Datagram Protocol, is a communications protocol that sends data over the internet. Unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), it’s a connectionless protocol that doesn’t ensure data packet delivery. It transmits datagrams – an independent, discrete packet of data – without first establishing a proper handshake between the sender and the receiver. The sender doesn’t wait for an acknowledgment after sending a datagram, and the receiver doesn’t send any acknowledgment upon receiving a datagram. This makes UDP faster but less reliable than TCP. UDP is used for time-sensitive transmissions where dropped packets are acceptable, such as in live video streaming, voice over IP (VoIP), and online multiplayer gaming.</p>
