<p>Architecture can be done on several “levels” of abstractions. The level influences the importance of necessary skills. As there are many categorizations possible my favorite segmentation includes these 3 levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Level:</strong> The lowest level of architecture. Focus on one single application. Very detailed, low level design. Communication is usually within one development team.</li>
<li><strong>Solution Level:</strong> The mid-level of architecture. Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design. Communication is between multiple development teams.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise Level:</strong> The highest level of architecture. Focus on multiple solutions. High level, abstract design, which needs to be detailed out by solution or application architects. Communication is across the organization.</li>
</ul>
