<p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an enterprise-wide approach to software development of application components that takes advantage of reusable software components, or services.</p>
<p>SOA provides four different service types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functional services (i.e., business services), which are critical for business applications.</li>
<li>Enterprise services, which serve to implement functionality.</li>
<li>Application services, which are used to develop and deploy apps.</li>
<li>Infrastructure services, which are instrumental for backend processes like security and authentication.</li>
</ol>
