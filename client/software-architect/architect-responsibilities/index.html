<p>To understand the necessary skills an architect needs, we first need to understand typical activities. The following list contains from my perspective the most important activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define and decide development technology and platform</li>
<li>Define development standards, e.g., coding standards, tools, review processes, test approach, etc.</li>
<li>Support identifying and understanding business requirements</li>
<li>Design systems and take decisions based on requirements</li>
<li>Document and communicate architectural definitions, design and decisions</li>
<li>Check and review architecture and code, e.g., check if defined patterns and coding standards are implemented properly</li>
<li>Collaborate with other architects and stakeholders</li>
<li>Coach and consult developers</li>
<li>Make sure that as implementation takes place, the architecture is being adhered to</li>
<li>Play a key part in reviewing code</li>
<li>Detail out and refine higher level design into lower level design</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Architecture is a continuous activity, especially when it is applied in agile software development. Therefore, these activities are done over and over again.</em></p>
