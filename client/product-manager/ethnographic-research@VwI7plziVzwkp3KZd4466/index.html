<p>Ethnographic research, stemming from anthropology, is a significant methodology often adopted by product managers to gain a profound understanding of user behaviours, routines, cultures, and motivations in their natural surroundings. It is essential as it offers contextual and holistic insights on user behaviour that other methods, like surveys or interviews, may not provide. For a product manager, this research helps compose a more empathetic and comprehensive user point-of-view, thus successfully driving product decisions that meet usersâ€™ needs more effectively. This may involve observing users interact with the product in their everyday life, carrying out contextual inquiry, or even studying competitors to understand the factors that drive users towards specific actions. Understanding the subtleties of user behaviour through ethnographic research can truly create the difference between a good product and a great one.</p>
