<p>Stakeholder engagement is an essential function for a product manager. It involves the identification, communication with, and management of individuals or groups who have an interest or are affected by the products being developed or managed. This could range from internal teams like design, development, and marketing to external entities like customers, partners, and regulators. A product manager must effectively engage stakeholders to understand their needs and concerns, gather valuable inputs, align the product vision, and eventually drive product success.</p>
