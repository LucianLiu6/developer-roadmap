<p>For a product manager, understanding user stories is an essential part of defining product requirements. A user story is a tool used in Agile development that captures a description of a product feature from an end-user perspective. User Stories helps the product manager not only in understanding and noting down the userâ€™s perspective but also in communicating this perspective to the design and development teams efficiently. User stories depict the type of user, what they want, and why, giving the team a clear focus of what needs to be accomplished. Therefore, as a product manager, utilizing user stories can lead to products that meet user expectations and demands effectively.</p>
