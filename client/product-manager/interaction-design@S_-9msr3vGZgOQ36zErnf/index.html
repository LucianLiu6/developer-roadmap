<p>Interaction Design is a key discipline within the field of Product Management. It focuses on the design and creation of digital interfaces and systems with which human users interact. As a product manager, mastery in interaction design is critical because the ease-of-use, intuitiveness, and satisfaction of a userâ€™s interaction with a product largely determine its success or failure. An Interaction-design-savvy product manager will strive to make sure the product offers a seamless user experience, ensuring it is aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate, and delivers the desired functionality efficiently.</p>
