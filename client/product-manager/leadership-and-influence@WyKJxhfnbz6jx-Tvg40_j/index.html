<p>The roles of a Product Manager extend beyond merely guiding product development. Leadership and influence are integral to a Product Manager’s toolkit. With a unique, cross-functional role that interacts with various departments such as design, engineering, and marketing, a Product Manager needs to inspire and mobilize teams towards a singular product vision. Moreover, they must effectively communicate, influence decisions, and advocate for their product in the face of potential resistance, all the while fostering a climate that empowers team members and stakeholders. This underscores the necessity for skills in leadership and influence in product management, underlining its significance beyond technical knowledge and tactical expertise.</p>
