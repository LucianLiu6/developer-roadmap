<p>Competitive advantage stands at the core of a product managerâ€™s role and responsibilities. A competitive advantage ensures that a product or service has unique attributes that set it apart from rival offerings, providing a strategic advantage in the market. A product manager must understand and leverage this unique value proposition to attract, retain, and potentially expand the customer base. Thus, competitive advantage is essential for creating strategies, defining the roadmap, making crucial product decisions, and driving growth.</p>
