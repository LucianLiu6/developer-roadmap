<p>The role of a Product Manager extends to managing and solving constraints regarding a product’s vision &#x26; mission. The mission is the purpose that propels the product towards its ultimate goal, while the vision outlines where the organization or product aims to be in the future. The complexities lie in the constraints that might hinder the product’s way to achieve its vision and mission. These constraints could be technical, financial, time-bound, resource-based, and more. The Product Manager’s responsibility is to identify these constraints, design strategies to overcome them, and effectively implement those strategies, thereby channeling energy in alignment with the product’s mission and vision.</p>
