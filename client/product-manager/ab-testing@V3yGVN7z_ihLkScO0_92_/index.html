<p>The role of a Product Manager often requires making informed decisions to improve product performance and user experience. This is where A/B Testing, a vital aspect of data-driven decision making, comes into play. A/B Testing, also known as split testing, involves comparing two versions of a webpage, ad, or other product experience to see which performs better. It is a methodical approach that enables product managers to determine the impact of changes and make data-driven decisions. It helps reduce the inherent uncertainty in introducing new features or changes and is a key tool in the product managerâ€™s arsenal.</p>
