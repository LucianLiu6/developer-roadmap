<p>Positioning, within the realm of product management, refers to the delicate art of crafting and communicating a product’s unique value proposition to the intended audience, in relation to competing products. It’s about defining where your product fits into the market and how it should be perceived by its consumer base. A seasoned Product Manager meticulously shapes and controls this perception in order to strengthen the product’s standing in the market, increase sales, and boost the overall brand image. The correct positioning strategy can ultimately lead to a product’s success or failure. For Product Managers, mastering this strategic function is a key element in directing both product development and marketing efforts.</p>
