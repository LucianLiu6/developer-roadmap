<p>When it comes to the role of a Product Manager, brainstorming techniques are paramount, especially during the stage of Product Identification. This initial stage involves the generation and rallying of innovative ideas that could potentially translate into a viable product. The Product Manager is required to leverage different techniques, like mind maps, SWOT analysis, SCAMPER, or Six Thinking Hats, to effectively encourage creativity, drive cross-functional collaboration, and foster a breeding ground for market-leading product concepts. Effective brainstorming sessions can reveal unique market opportunities, create an alignment of vision among teams, and contribute to the overall product strategy.</p>
