<p>As a Product Manager, building and leading teams are crucial aspects of one’s role. This involves assembling a competent and diverse team and establishing a shared vision and goals. Once the team has been formed, it’s up to the Product Manager to guide, motivate, and manage the team to drive the grand vision into reality. They need to exhibit strong leadership qualities, foster a healthy and collaborative work environment, recognize individual contributions and ensure that every member feels valued for their work. This involves not just managing but also mentoring and empowering the team to take ownership and deliver their best work. This process of team building and leadership directly influences the successful execution of a product’s lifecycle.</p>
