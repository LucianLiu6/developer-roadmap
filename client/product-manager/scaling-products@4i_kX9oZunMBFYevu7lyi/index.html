<p>Scaling products is a crucial responsibility of a Product Manager. It involves optimizing a product’s infrastructure and processes to cater to an increasing number of users or requests, without compromising on its efficiency or functionality. This process not only involves improving actual product features but also business strategies such as go-to-market plans, revenue models, and customer relations. A successful Product Manager has a specific scale-up strategy in place, effectively enabling product growth while managing potential risks. Being able to scale products successfully is a hallmark of a successful product, crucial to the company’s long-term sustainability and profitability.</p>
