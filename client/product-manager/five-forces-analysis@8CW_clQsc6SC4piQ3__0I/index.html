<p>Five Forces Analysis, developed by Michael E. Porter, is a critical tool that a Product Manager can utilize to understand the competitive forces within the industry and help inform product development strategy. This analysis includes five different forces: potential new entrants, substitute products or services, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers and competitive rivalry. By thoroughly examining these areas, a Product Manager can uncover opportunities, mitigate challenges, and position the product to achieve sustainable profitability. It also supports crucial decisions around pricing, marketing, and development prioritization. Thus, mastering Five Forces Analysis is fundamental for successful product management.</p>
