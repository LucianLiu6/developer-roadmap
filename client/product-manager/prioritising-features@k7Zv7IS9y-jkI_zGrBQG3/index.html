<p>The role of a Product Manager often necessitates the task of prioritising features in a productâ€™s development roadmap. This pivotal process involves identifying what features or enhancements will serve the product, business, and customers best, considering the balance of business viability, technical feasibility, and customer desirability. Numerous methodologies can be applied to feature prioritisation, including the MoSCoW method, RICE scoring, or the Kano model, each influencing the order of feature implementation. Perfecting this process can lead to improved resource allocation, better product releases, and maximized customer satisfaction.</p>
