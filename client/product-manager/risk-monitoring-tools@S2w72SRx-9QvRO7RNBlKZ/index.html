<p>As a Product Manager, one of the key responsibilities is understanding and managing risks associated with the product. Risk Monitoring Tools play an integral role in this process. These tools are specialized software designed to identify, assess, track, and mitigate risks in product development and releases. They provide data-driven insights on potential hazards, allowing product managers to make informed decisions and implement strategies to prevent or minimize risk impacts. These tools can help in tracking the progress of risk resolution, visualize risk prioritization, and alert the product managers about the upcoming risks in time.</p>
