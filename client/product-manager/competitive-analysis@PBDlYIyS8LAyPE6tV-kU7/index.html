<p>Understanding the competitive landscape is a critical aspect of a Product Managerâ€™s role. Competitive analysis involves identifying your competitors and evaluating their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to your own product or service. A product manager uses competitive analysis to understand market trends, discover opportunities for growth, and determine competitive advantages. It is an essential factor in positioning, marketing, and strategic decision-making. This process of understanding often involves collecting and reviewing information about competitor products, including their features, functionality, pricing structures, and success within target markets.</p>
