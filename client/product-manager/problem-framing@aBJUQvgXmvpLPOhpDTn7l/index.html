<p>Problem Framing is a vigorous process undertaken by Product Managers to clearly understand, articulate, and define the issues that a product or service aims to resolve. It necessitates critical and creative thinking to identify the root cause of a problem, its potential implications, its users, and the impact of its solutions. Essentially, a well-framed problem can guide Product Managers while they navigate through the productâ€™s design and development phases, ensuring that the final product successfully addresses the issue at hand and delivers substantial value to its users.</p>
