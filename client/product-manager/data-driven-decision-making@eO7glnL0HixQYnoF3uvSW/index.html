<p>As a product manager, having a good grip on data-driven decision making is a pivotal skill to have. It is a process where decisions are made based on actual data rather than intuitions or observations. This process helps product managers evaluate where the product stands in terms of its effectiveness, performance, and reception in the market. Decisions are then made about the productâ€™s future based on this analysis - whether it needs improvements, new features, or a different marketing approach. By focusing on data-driven decision making, product managers can make choices that are more likely to bring in positive results and reduce risks associated with intuition-based decision making.</p>
