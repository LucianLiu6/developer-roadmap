<p>As a product manager, understanding, defining, and communicating your product’s value proposition is vital. It refers to the unique value that a product or service provides to a customer, highlighting the reasons why they should choose your product over competitors. It’s a differentiator that sets your product apart and communicates the additional benefits that customers would receive. A compelling value proposition aligns with customer needs and demands, positions your product fittingly in the market, and serves as a foundation for the product strategy and roadmap.</p>
