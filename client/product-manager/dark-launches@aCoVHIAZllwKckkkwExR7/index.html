<p>Dark Launches are a valuable strategy in product management. Essentially, they refer to the release of features to a subset of users before the official launch. These unannounced releases, invisible to the majority of users, provide product managers crucial data about how the feature functions in a live environment. They enable product managers to observe real user interactions, gather feedback, identify bugs and areas of improvement prior to a broad scale rollout. This greatly reduces the risk of encountering major issues post-launch and helps ensure a smoother user experience, making dark launches a critical weapon in a product manager’s arsenal.</p>
