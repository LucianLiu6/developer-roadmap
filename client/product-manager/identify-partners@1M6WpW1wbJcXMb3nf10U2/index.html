<p>Identifying partners is a critical element in the role of a Product Manager. This refers to the process of discovering and aligning with other individuals, teams, or organizations that can assist in boosting the productâ€™s value proposition. This is achieved either by improving its features, outreach, access to resources, or customer adaptations. A strategic alliance can streamline the process of product development and provide access to niche markets and specialized technologies. Solid partnerships can amplify the potential of the product, save resources and time, and provide a competitive advantage in a saturated market landscape.</p>
