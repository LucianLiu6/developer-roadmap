<p>Communication Skills are crucial for a product manager as they act as the bridge between different stakeholders such as development, design, marketing, and executives. Effective communication enables a product manager to share their visions, align the team towards common goals, and articulate stakeholder needs clearly. These skills help to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, ensuring the successful implementation of product strategies. Without efficient communication skills, a product manager will struggle to convey their ideas, which can ultimately lead to ineffective strategies and unsuccessful products.</p>
