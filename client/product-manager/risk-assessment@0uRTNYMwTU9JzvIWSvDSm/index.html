<p>Risk Assessment is an essential tool in the lifecycle of product management. It involves the identification and analysis of potential risks that could negatively impact key business initiatives or critical projects. As a Product Manager, understanding and managing these risks can not only prevent potential issues but also prepare the team with strategic solutions to counteract them. Implementing effective risk assessment can result in improved product quality, reduced costs, and increased stakeholder satisfaction. It is a dynamic process that should be revisited throughout the product development process to minimize threats and maximize opportunities.</p>
