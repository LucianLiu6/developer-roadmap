<p>Contingency planning constitutes an integral part of risk mitigation strategies for any Product Manager. It involves identifying potential risks and developing plans to prevent, respond to, or minimize the impact of those risks on the product development process. For a Product Manager, contingency planning entails envisioning various scenarios that could lead to setbacks in the delivery of the product and devising alternate plans. This acts as a safeguard to ensure smooth operations and delivery of the product on time, catering to user expectations. It provides a roadmap to manage unforeseen problems and reduces potential losses by maintaining the consistency and quality of the product.</p>
