<p>Risk Mitigation plays an essential role in the realm of Product Management. It’s the responsibility of a Product Manager to anticipate potential pitfalls and create strategies to minimize their impact on the product’s development and lifecycle. It requires a deep understanding of the project’s scope, stakeholders’ expectations, market trends and potential technical constraints. By intimately knowing the product and the environment in which it operates, a product manager can effectively strategize against any risk and ensure that the product stays on its intended course towards success.</p>
