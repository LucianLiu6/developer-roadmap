<p>Blue Ocean Strategy is a significant methodology in product identification for a Product Manager. It’s a marketing theory from a book published in 2005 which advocates the creation of new demand in uncontested market spaces, or “Blue Oceans”. Rather than competing within the confines of the existing industry or trying to steal customers from rivals (Red Ocean Strategy), Blue Ocean Strategy proposes to create a new space in the market, thereby making the competition irrelevant.</p>
<p>From a product management perspective, this involves implementing innovative ideas, seeking new opportunities and envisioning potential markets. Product Managers, hence, are able to utilize this strategy to develop unique products that can trigger exponential growth and success for their organizations. In a nutshell, Blue Ocean Strategy provides a creative and systematic approach towards successful product identification and differentiation.</p>
