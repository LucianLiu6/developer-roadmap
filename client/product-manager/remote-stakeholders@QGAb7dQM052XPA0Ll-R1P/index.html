<p>The role of a Product Manager involves not only managing a product but also interacting and coordinating with diverse stakeholders. Working with remote stakeholders is a common scenario that Product Managers encounter in their work life. Stakeholders could range from engineers based in different locations, sales teams distributed globally, or even customers who could be states or continents away. The nuances of managing these remote stakeholders, understanding their requirements and expectations, communicating effectively despite time zone differences, and creating a synergy towards a common goal are crucial elements in the role of a Product Manager. Getting it right often results in well-executed projects and stellar products.</p>
