<p>Retrospectives, also known as “retros”, play an essential role in the life of a Product Manager. These are regular meetings where the team reflects on the past cycle of work, discussing what went well and where improvements should be made. For Product Managers, retrospectives provide an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of product strategies, to understand challenges faced during implementation, and to glean insights for future planning. These sessions are critical for continuous improvement, fostering a culture of transparency, and ensuring alignment across the team.</p>
