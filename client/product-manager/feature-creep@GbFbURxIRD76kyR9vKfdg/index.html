<p>Feature creep, also known as requirements creep or scope creep, is a term commonly used by product managers. It refers to the continuous expansion or accumulation of features in a product, that goes beyond its original scope and requirements. This can lead to project bloat and veer off the product from its intended course and business objectives. Despite the temptation to add more features to satisfy varied user requirements, a good product manager should keep a balance and manage feature creep effectively. The aim is not only to deliver a product that meets the users’ needs, but also stays on schedule, within budget and aligned with the product vision.</p>
