<p>For a product manager, understanding the needs, wants, and experiences of users is a critical task. This comprehension is often facilitated through user research, where tools like surveys and questionnaires come into the picture. These tools enable product managers to garner valuable insights about user behavior, preferences, and pain points. With well-crafted surveys and questionnaires, product managers can proactively address user needs, refine product strategy, and ultimately create products that provide high value and usability.</p>
