<p>Product requirements are a vital component in the realm of product management. They represent the critical elements, features, and functionalities that a product must possess to meet the needs and expectations of customers, stakeholders, and the business itself. Product Managers hold the responsibility to define, document, and communicate these requirements effectively with all parties involved. This process involves understanding customer needs, market trends, and technical feasibility, translating these understandings into well-defined requirements for the development teams. Thus, mastering the art of product requirements is an essential skill for a successful Product Manager.</p>
