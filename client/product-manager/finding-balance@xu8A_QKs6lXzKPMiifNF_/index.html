<p>As a Product Manager, one vital skill required of you is understanding the balance between value and features. This revolves around prioritizing what features to implement based on the value they provide to the customer or user. It is about striking a balance; not all features will provide the same level of value, and understanding this is key to efficient resource allocation. You must maintain a focus on delivering value while also ensuring the productâ€™s features remain compelling and relevant to the target audience.</p>
