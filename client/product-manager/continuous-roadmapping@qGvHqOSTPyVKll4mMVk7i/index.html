<p>In the dynamic world of product development, a Product Manager needs to utilize effective strategies to navigate the fluctuating market needs and demands. Continuous Roadmapping is an essential tool that allows for flexible and adaptable planning in line with these changes. Under this methodology, product managers continually adapt and update the product roadmap as new information, data, and feedback become available. This enables them to respond proactively to shifts in business goals, customer needs, and the market landscape, ensuring that the product remains relevant and competitive, while aligning its development with the brandâ€™s strategic objectives.</p>
