<p>For a Product Manager, User Interviews are a key instrument in User Research. They provide a pristine opportunity to understand the user’s needs, problems, motivations, and behaviors. This process involves having a one-on-one conversation with current or potential users of a product to understand their experiences with the product, to gain insights about their needs and wants, and to determine how a product can be improved to meet the user’s expectations. If conducted effectively, user interviews can help a Product Manager to make informed product development decisions thereby increasing user satisfaction and product success.</p>
