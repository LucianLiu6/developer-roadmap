<p>MAU (Monthly Active Users) is a critical performance metric that product managers often use to gauge the user engagement and growth of a digital product such as a mobile app, a SaaS product, or a website. It refers to the unique users who engage with the product at least once within a month. As a product manager, understanding the MAU helps in designing effective marketing strategies, making product enhancements, and ultimately driving the productâ€™s success.</p>
