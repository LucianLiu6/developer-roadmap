<p>UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design are integral parts of product management. A product manager often works closely with UX/UI designers to ensure that the product not only meets the functional requirements but also provides a seamless and engaging user experience. UX design focuses on the overall feel of the product, ensuring it solves problems for users effectively and provides a positive experience. On the other hand, UI design concentrates on the aesthetics of the product â€“ its look and feel, responsiveness, and interactivity. Understanding UX/UI design is vital for a product manager as it heavily influences user satisfaction and product success.</p>
