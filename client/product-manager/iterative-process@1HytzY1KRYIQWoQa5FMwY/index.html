<p>The Iterative Process is a fundamental approach in product management, which allows Product Managers to continuously improve and refine their products. In essence, it means creating, testing, refining, and repeating. Using this methodology, a Product Manager incrementally enhances the product based on feedback and learnings from each iteration. This constant evolution of the product makes for a more flexible development process, particularly useful in dynamic environments where user needs or market conditions may frequently change. Understanding and applying the Iterative Process can greatly enhance the ability of a Product Manager to deliver an effective and successful product to the market.</p>
