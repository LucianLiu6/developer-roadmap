<p>”IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three types of cloud service models. <strong>IaaS</strong> or Infrastructure as a Service provides users with a resource-based service via virtualization technology, offering computing infrastructure, physical or (more often) virtual machines and other resources. <strong>PaaS</strong> or Platform as a Service provides runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applications, it is utilized for software development and offers a platform to developers to build applications and services over the internet. <strong>SaaS</strong> or Software as a Service provides on-demand software accessed via the internet, it delivers a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider.”</p>
