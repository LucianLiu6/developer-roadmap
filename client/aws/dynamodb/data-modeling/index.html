<p>In AWS DynamoDB, data modeling is a process that involves determining how to organize, access, and understand the data stored in a database. This process is crucial as it outlines how data will be stored and accessed across a wide range of databases and applications. The primary components of data modeling in DynamoDB include tables, items, and attributes. Tables are collections of data. Items are individual pieces of data that are stored in a table. Attributes are elements of data that relate to a particular item. DynamoDB uses a NoSQL model which means itâ€™s schema-less, i.e., the data can be structured in any way that your business needs<br>
prescribe, and can be changed at any time. This contrasts with traditional relational databases which require pre-defined schemas.</p>
