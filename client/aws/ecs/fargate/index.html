<p>Fargate is a technology used for the deployment of containers in Amazonâ€™s Elastic Container Service (ECS). This technology completely removes the need to manage the EC2 instances for your infrastructure; therefore, you would not have to be concerned about selecting the right type of EC2 instances, deciding when to scale your clusters, or optimizing cluster packing. In simple terms, Fargate allows you to focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure.</p>
