<p>AWS EC2 instances come in a variety of types optimized to fit different use cases. They are grouped into categories depending on their performance capacity and pricing structure. There are five categories of instance types including General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, and Accelerated Computing instances. Each category is suited best for specific workloads and they consist of different instance types each given a specific name, for example, ‘t2.micro’. Each instance type has a specific amount of CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity. Understanding the workloads of your applications can help you determine which instance type would be best suited to your needs.</p>
