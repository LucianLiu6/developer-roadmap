<p>Amazon EC2 provides several purchasing options to fit different workload needs. The <strong>On-Demand</strong> option allows clients to pay for compute capacity per hour with no long-term commitments. <strong>Reserved Instances</strong> provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing and are ideal for applications required steady state usage. <strong>Spot Instances</strong> allow clients to bid for unused Amazon EC2 capacity and can provide significant savings if flexibility is possible in starting and stopping times. <strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong> are physical EC2 servers dedicated to specific clients, suitable for regulatory requirements and licenses which do not support multi-tenant virtualization, and <strong>Savings Plans</strong> offer reduced rates for committing to a consistent amount of usage for 1 or 3 years.</p>
