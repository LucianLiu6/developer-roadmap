<p>AWS ElastiCache quotas define the limit on the maximum number of clusters, nodes, parameter groups, and subnet groups you can create in an AWS account. These quotas vary by region and can be increased upon request to the AWS Service team. Quotas for ElastiCache are implemented to prevent unintentional overconsumption of resources. Itâ€™s important to monitor your current usage and understand the quotas of your account to efficiently manage your ElastiCache resources.</p>
