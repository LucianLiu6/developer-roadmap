<p>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is a standard that prevents email spoofing. It allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message in a way that can be verified by mailbox providers. This verification is made possible through cryptographic authentication. In Amazon SES, you can setup DKIM by adding a set of three CNAME records to the DNS configuration of your sending domain. Each record maps a fictitious subdomain of your sending domain to a domain maintained by Amazon SES. After you add these records and they propagate through the internetâ€™s DNS infrastructure, you can start sending authenticated email from your domain.</p>
