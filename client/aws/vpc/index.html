<p>Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define. It provides advanced security features such as security groups and network access control lists to enable inbound and outbound filtering at the instance and subnet level. Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC to leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.</p>
