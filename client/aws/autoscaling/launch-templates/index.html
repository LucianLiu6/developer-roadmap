<p>”Launch Templates” in AWS Auto Scaling are configurations that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. They store the configuration information necessary to launch an instance, which includes the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the storage configuration. It helps in setting up new instances quickly and prevent configuration inconsistencies across instances. These templates can also be versioned, allowing updates and roll backs to previous configurations.</p>
