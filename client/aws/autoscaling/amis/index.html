<p>Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are pre-configured templates for EC2 instances. When you launch an instance in EC2, you start with an AMI. An AMI includes details such as the operating system to use, applications to install, and the volume type and size. AMIs can be either public or private â€” public AMIs are available for anyone to use, while private AMIs are only available to specific AWS accounts. You can create your own custom AMIs, enabling you to quickly start and replicate a known configuration for your EC2 instances.</p>
