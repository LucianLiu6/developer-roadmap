<p>Resource-based policies are attached directly to the AWS resources that receive the permissions. The policy then specifies what actions are allowed or denied on that particular resource. In resource-based policies, you include a <code>Principal</code> element in the policy to indicate the IAM users or roles that are granted the permissions. While not all AWS services support resource-based policies, common services that do include Amazon S3 for bucket policies, AWS KMS for key policies, and Amazon SNS for topic policies.</p>
