<p>Route53 health checks enable you to monitor the health and performance of your applications, network, and servers. You can create custom health checks that verify the status of specific resources, such as a web server or email server. If the health check fails, Route 53 routes traffic away from the unhealthy resources. Health checks run periodically, at intervals that you specify, to help you detect issues before your end-users do. You can configure alarms to notify you when a resource becomes unhealthy, helping you respond rapidly to potential issues. AWS Route 53 Health Checks also integrates with CloudWatch, providing detailed metrics and graphs for analyzed data.</p>
