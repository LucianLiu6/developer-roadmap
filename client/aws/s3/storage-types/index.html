<p>Amazon S3 provides three storage classes: S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, and S3 Glacier. <code>S3 Standard</code> is designed for frequently accessed data. It delivers low latency and high throughput. <code>S3 Intelligent-Tiering</code> is automated storage class that optimizes costs. It moves objects between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based on changing access patterns. <code>S3 Glacier</code> is for long-term backup and archives. It has two retrieval modes: Expedited (for quick access) and Bulk (for largest and less time-sensitive retrievals).</p>
