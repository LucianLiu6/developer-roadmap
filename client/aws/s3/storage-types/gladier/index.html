<p>AWS Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. It is designed to reliably store data for as long as you need. Its main features are optimized for infrequently accessed data where retrieval time of minutes is acceptable. AWS Glacier supports the archiving of data that is not needed in real-time but might be required for future reference or are legally required to be maintained. AWS Glacier is used when there is no immediate need for data and substantial retrieval time is acceptable, due to its low storage cost.</p>
