<p>In TypeScript, access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of class properties and methods. There are three access modifiers in TypeScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public:</code> This is the default access modifier. Properties and methods declared as public can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.</li>
<li><code>private:</code> Properties and methods declared as private can only be accessed within the same class. They are not accessible from outside the class.</li>
<li><code>protected:</code> Properties and methods declared as protected can be accessed within the class and its subclasses. They are not accessible from outside the class and its subclasses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Access modifiers in TypeScript allow you to define the level of visibility and accessibility of properties and methods in your class, making your code more maintainable and secure.</p>
