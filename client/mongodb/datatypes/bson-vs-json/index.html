<p>In MongoDB, data is stored in a binary format called BSON (Binary JSON), which is a superset of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). While both BSON and JSON are used to represent data in MongoDB, they have some key differences.</p>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p>BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. It is designed to be efficient in storage, traversability, and encoding/decoding. Some of its key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary Encoding</strong>: BSON encodes data in a binary format, which offers better performance and allows the storage of data types not supported by JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Additional Data Types</strong>: BSON supports more data types compared to JSON, such as <code>Date</code>, <code>Binary</code>, <code>ObjectId</code>, and <code>Decimal128</code>. This makes it possible to represent diverse data more accurately in MongoDB documents.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Traversability</strong>: In BSON, the size of each element is encoded, which makes it easy to skip over elements, thus making the traversal faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p>JSON is a lightweight and human-readable data representation format that can be easily parsed and generated by many programming languages. It is used widely as a medium for transmitting data over the web. Some features of JSON include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-readable</strong>: JSON is textual with a simple structure, making it easy for humans to read and write.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperable</strong>: JSON can be easily parsed and generated by many different programming languages, making it a popular choice for data interchange between applications.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Data Types</strong>: JSON supports fewer data types compared to BSON, such as strings, numbers, booleans, and <code>null</code>. This means that some data, like dates or binary data, must be represented as strings or custom objects in JSON.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>While BSON and JSON are related, they serve different purposes in the context of MongoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSON is the binary format used by MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently with support for additional native data types.</li>
<li>JSON, being a more human-readable and widely used format, is typically used for data interchange between MongoDB and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using BSON internally, MongoDB can take advantage of its benefits in storage, traversability, and a richer data type representation while still providing the interoperability and readability of JSON through query interfaces and drivers.</p>
