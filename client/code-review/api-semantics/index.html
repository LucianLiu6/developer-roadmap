<ul>
<li>API as small as possible, as large as needed?</li>
<li>Is there one way of doing one thing, not multiple ones?</li>
<li>Is it consistent, does it follow the principle of least surprise?</li>
<li>Clean split of API/internals without internals leaking into the API?</li>
<li>Are there no breaking changes to user-facing parts (API classes, configuration, metrics, log formats, etc)?</li>
<li>Is a new API generally useful and not overly specific to a single use case?</li>
</ul>
