<p>Performance Testing is a subset of Performance Engineering. It is a process of evaluating a system’s behavior under various extreme conditions. The main intent of performance testing is to monitor and improve key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, memory, CPU utilization, and more.</p>
<p>There are three objectives (three S) of Performance testing to observe and evaluate: <code>Speed</code>, <code>Scalability</code> and <code>Stability</code>. Following are the commonly used performance testing types, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load Testing</li>
<li>Stress Testing</li>
<li>Spike Testing</li>
<li>Endurance Testing</li>
<li>Volume Testing</li>
<li>Scalability Testing</li>
<li>Capacity Testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Load Testing is one type of performance testing. It helps to evaluate the application under tests’ behaviors such as response time, throughput, pass/fail transactions, and more under the normal workload. e.g., cart checkout response time is 500 milliseconds under typical business hours.</p>
