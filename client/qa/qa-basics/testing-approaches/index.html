<p>Test approach has two techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive - An approach in which the test design process is initiated as early as possible in order to find and fix the defects before the build is created.</li>
<li>Reactive - An approach in which the testing is not started until after design and coding are completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three approaches are commonly used to implement functional testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Box Testing</li>
<li>White Box Testing</li>
<li>Gray Box Testing</li>
</ul>
