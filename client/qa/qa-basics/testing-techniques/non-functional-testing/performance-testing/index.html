<p>Performance Testing is a subset of Performance Engineering. It is a process of evaluating a system’s behavior under various extreme conditions. The main intent of performance testing is monitoring and improving key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, memory, CPU utilization, and more.</p>
<p>There are three objectives (three S) of Performance testing to observe and evaluate: <code>Speed</code>, <code>Scalability</code>, and <code>Stability</code>.</p>
