<p>The <code>wc</code> command is a commonly used tool in Unix or Linux that allows users to count the number of bytes, characters, words, and lines in a file or in data piped from standard input. The name <code>wc</code> stands for ‘word count’, but it can do much more than just count words. Common usage of <code>wc</code> includes tracking program output, counting code lines, and more. It’s an invaluable tool for analyzing text at both granular and larger scales.</p>
<p>Below is a basic usage example for <code>wc</code> in Linux:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">wc</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> myfile.txt</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command would output the number of lines, words, and characters in <code>myfile.txt</code>. The output is displayed in the following order: line count, word count, character count, followed by the filename.</p>
