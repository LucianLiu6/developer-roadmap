<p><code>join</code> is a powerful text processing command in Linux. It lets you combine lines of two files on a common field, which works similar to the ‘Join’ operation in SQL. It’s particularly useful when you’re dealing with large volumes of data. Specifically, <code>join</code> uses the lines from two files to form lines that contain pairs of lines related in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have two files that have a list of items, one with costs and the other with quantities, you can use <code>join</code> to combine these two files so each item has a cost and quantity on the same line.</p>
