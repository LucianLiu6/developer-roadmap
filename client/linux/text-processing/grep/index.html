<p>GREP (Global Regular Expression Print) is considered a significant tool in text processing area on Unix-like operating systems including Linux. It is a powerful utility that searches and filters text matching a given pattern. When it identifies a line that matches the pattern, it prints the line to the screen, offering an effective and a codified way to find text within files.</p>
<p>An essential part of many shell scripts, bash commands, and command-line operations, GREP is a versatile tool that comes pre-installed with every Linux distribution. It embodies three main parts - format, action and regex. Over the years, it had been effectively utilized in multiple programming languages and data science applications.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple GREP command:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">grep</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> "</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">pattern</span><span style="color:#E9F284">"</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> fileName</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command will search for the specified pattern within the file and prints the line to the terminal.</p>
<p>There is also an alternative to <code>grep</code> - <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast text processor that supports all the features of <code>grep</code> and extends it.</p>
