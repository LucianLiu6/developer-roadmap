<p>In Linux, <code>uniq</code> is an extremely useful command-line program for text processing. It aids in the examination and manipulation of text files by comparing or filtering out repeated lines that are adjacent. Whether you’re dealing with a list of data or a large text document, the <code>uniq</code> command allows you to find and filter out duplicate lines, or even provide a count of each unique line in a file. It’s important to remember that <code>uniq</code> only removes duplicates that are next to each other, so to get the most out of this command, data is often sorted using the <code>sort</code> command first.</p>
<p>An example of using <code>uniq</code> would be:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sort</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> names.txt</span><span style="color:#FF79C6"> |</span><span style="color:#50FA7B"> uniq</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>names.txt</code> is a file containing a list of names. The <code>sort</code> command sorts all the lines in the file, and then the <code>uniq</code> command removes all the duplicate lines. The resulting output would be a list of unique names from <code>names.txt</code>.</p>
