<p>awk is a powerful text-processing language that is widely used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. Named after its three original developers - Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan, awk is adept at performing operations upon text files, such as sorting, filtering, and report generation.</p>
<p>The language comprises a set of commands within a script that define pattern-action pairs. Essentially, awk reads an input file line by line, identifies patterns that match what is specified in the script, and consequently executes actions upon those matches.</p>
<p>Though a complete language with variables, expressions, and control structures, awk is most commonly used as a single-line command within bash shell scripts, leveraging its versatile text manipulation capabilities.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to print first two fields of each line of a file using awk:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="awk"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F8F8F2">awk '{</span><span style="color:#FF79C6">print</span><span style="color:#BD93F9;font-style:italic"> $1</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">,</span><span style="color:#BD93F9;font-style:italic">$2</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">}' filename</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This would display the first and second field (typically separated by spaces) of every line in ‘filename’.</p>
