<p>The Linux shell is a command-line interface or terminal used to interact directly with the operating system. The shell helps facilitate system commands and acts as an intermediary interface between the user and the systemâ€™s kernel. The shell can perform complex tasks efficiently and quickly. There are many types of shells available in Linux, including the Bourne Shell (sh), the C Shell (csh), and the Bourne-Again Shell (bash).</p>
<p>The basics of using a Linux shell include navigating between directories, creating, renaming and deleting files and directories, and executing system commands. This introductory level knowledge is crucial for Linux system administration, scripting, and automation.</p>
<p>Here is a classic <code>bash</code> command as an example, which prints the current directory:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD">pwd</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
