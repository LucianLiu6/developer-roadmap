<p>In Linux, environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the behavior of running processes in a shell. They exist in every shell session. A shell session’s environment includes, but is not limited to, the user’s home directory, command search path, terminal type, and program preferences.</p>
<p>Environment variables help to contribute to the fantastic and customizable flexibility you see in Unix systems. They provide a simple way to share configuration settings between multiple applications and processes in Linux.</p>
<p>You can use the ‘env’ command to list all the environment variables in a shell session. If you want to print a particular variable, such as the PATH variable, you can use the ‘echo $PATH’ command.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how you would do that:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"># List all environment variables</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">$</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> env</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"># Print a particular variable like PATH</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">$</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> echo</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> $PATH</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>Remember, every shell, such as Bourne shell, C shell, or Korn shell in Unix or Linux has different syntax and semantics to define and use environment variables.</p>
