<p>In Linux, moving files is an essential task that you will need to perform quite frequently. The <code>mv</code> command, short for move, is used to move files and directories from one location to another. The <code>mv</code> command can also be used for renaming files in Linux.</p>
<p>The general syntax for the <code>mv</code> command is as follows:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">mv</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> [options] source destination</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>source</code> denotes the file or directory that you want to move while <code>destination</code> denotes the location where you want to move your source file or directory.</p>
<p>The <code>mv</code> command is widely used because of its simplicity and versatility. Whether you want to organize your files by moving them into different directories or rename a bunch of files, the <code>mv</code> command is your go-to tool in Linux.</p>
