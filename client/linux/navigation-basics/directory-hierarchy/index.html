<p>In Linux, understanding the directory hierarchy is crucial for efficient navigation and file management. A Linux system’s directory structure, also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and instead organise them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner.</p>
<p>Each directory serves a specific purpose. For instance, <code>/bin</code> holds binary executable files (command files), <code>/etc</code> has system configuration files, <code>/home</code> stores users’ personal files, and <code>/var</code> contains varying files such as logs and print queues.</p>
<p>No code snippet is necessary as understanding directory hierarchy is a conceptual knowledge and doesn’t involve code execution.</p>
