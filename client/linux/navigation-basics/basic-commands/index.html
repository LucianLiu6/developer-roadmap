<p>In the world of Linux, understanding how to navigate through the system is quite essential. Unlike many other modern operating systems, Linux primarily uses command-line interfaces (CLI) thereby, making it necessary to get comfortable with different commands. These basic commands under Linux navigation involve moving around the file system, viewing the contents of directories, creating, renaming or deleting files/directories, and more. Navigating through Linux using these commands not only increases efficiency, but also provides a deeper understanding of the systemâ€™s file and directory structure.</p>
