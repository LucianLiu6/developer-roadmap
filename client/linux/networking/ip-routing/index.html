<p>IP Routing in Linux refers to the process of setting up routing tables and configuring network routes for networking interfaces within the Linux operating system. It is the kernelâ€™s responsibility to handle this task which involves the selection of pathways for sending network packets across to their intended destinations on a network.</p>
<p>This task is carried out using various command-line tools and the networking configuration files. The principle command-line tool for network configuration in Linux used to be <code>ifconfig</code>, but it has now been mostly replaced by the <code>ip</code> command.</p>
<p>For example, to view the routing table in Linux, the following command is used:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">$</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> ip</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> route</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> show</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command returns a list of all routes that are known to the kernel.</p>
