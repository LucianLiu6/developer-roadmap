<p>In Linux, file transfer is an act of copying or moving a file from one computer to another over a network connection. This concept is essential for system administrators and end-users who require the ability to share files between systems or networks.</p>
<p>Linux provides several command-line tools and applications for network-based file transfers. These tools support various standard protocols such as FTP, HTTP, SCP, SFTP, and NFS. Some of the most well-known commands for file transfer include <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code>, and <code>wget</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, when transferring a file from a local machine to a remote server, the <code>scp</code> command can be utilized as follows:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">scp</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> /path/to/local/file</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> username@remote:/path/to/destination</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command would copy the file to the designated remote system.</p>
<p>Understanding and efficiently using these tools can make the task of file sharing over networks streamlined, easier, and more secure.</p>
