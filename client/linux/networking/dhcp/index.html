<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a critical component of any network. In Linux networking, it is used for allocating IP addresses dynamically within a network.</p>
<p>The DHCP server effectively manages the IP addresses and information related to them, making sure that each client machine gets a unique IP and all the correct network information.</p>
<p>In Linux, DHCP can be configured and managed using terminal commands. This involves the installation of the DHCP server software, editing the configuration files, and managing the serverâ€™s services.</p>
<p>A traditional DHCP server should have a static IP address to manage the IP distribution effectively. The DHCP in Linux also handles DNS and other related data that your network might require.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a basic command to install a DHCP server in a Debian-based Linux:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> apt-get</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> install</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> isc-dhcp-server</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>After the installation process, all configurations of the DHCP server are done in the configuration file located at <code>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</code> which can be edited using any text editor.</p>
