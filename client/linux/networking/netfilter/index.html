<p>Netfilter is a powerful tool included in Linux that provides the functionality for maneuvering and altering network packets. It is essentially a framework that acts as an interface between the kernel and the packet, allowing for the manipulation and transformation of packets in transit.</p>
<p>Netfilter’s primary application is in developing firewall systems and managing network address translations (NATs). In Linux, netfilter is extremely valuable due to the wide range of applications it offers, from traffic control, packet modification, logging, and network intrusion detection.</p>
<p>The structure of netfilter allows for custom functions, often referred to as hooks, to be inserted into the kernel’s networking stack. These hooks can manipulate or inspect packets at various stages like prerouting, local in, forward, local out, and postrouting.</p>
<p>A common tool used in conjunction with netfilter is iptables, which provides a mechanism to configure the tables in the kernel provided by the Netfilter Framework.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using iptables with netfilter module to create a simple firewall rule:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">iptables</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -A</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> INPUT</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> eth0</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -s</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> 192.168.0.0/24</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -m</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> netfilter</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --netfilter-name</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> example</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --action</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> drop</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> </span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>In this command, ‘-A INPUT’ is adding a new rule to the ‘INPUT’ chain. ‘-i eth0’ is specifying the network interface, and ‘-s 192.168.0.0/24’ is designating the IP address range for the rule. ‘-m netfilter’ is calling the netfilter module, ‘—netfilter-name example’ is naming the rule, and ‘—action drop’ is specifying how to handle the matching packets (In this case, dropping them).</p>
