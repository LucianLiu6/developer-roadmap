<p>Package Management is a crucial concept in Linux that aids in the handling of packages (collections of files). It not only allows the user to install new software with single commands but also helps manage existing ones. This includes installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages. Package management incorporates a standardized system that keeps track of every softwareâ€™s prerequisites and takes care of installation, updates and removal.</p>
<p>Linux distributions use various package managers. Some of the commonly used are <code>apt</code> (Advanced Packaging Tool) for Debian-based distributions, <code>yum</code> (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and <code>dnf</code> (Dandified YUM) for Red-Hat-based distributions, and <code>pacman</code> for Arch Linux.</p>
<p>For instance, to install a package in a Debian-based distribution, you would use the following command in apt:</p>

<p>Such vital features have made package management systems an integral part of Linux distributions, allowing users to handle applications efficiently.</p>
