<p>Package management in Linux involves handling packages or modules of software, streamlining the process of installing, upgrading, and configuring Linux distributions. At the crux of pack management are repositories, critical components that store and manage collections of software packages.</p>
<p>A repository in Linux is a storage location from where the system retrieves and installs the necessary OS updates and applications. These repositories contain thousands of Software Packages or RPM Packages compiled for specific Linux distributions.</p>
<p>The specific repository used depends on the Linux distribution (like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) and the package format the distribution uses (like .deb in Debian and Ubuntu or .rpm in Fedora and CentOS).</p>
<p>Repositories provide a method of updating the tools and applications on your Linux system, and they also ensure all updates and dependencies work together and are tested for integration before they are released.</p>
<p>There is no standard way to use the repositories across various distributions, each comes with its pre-configured set of repositories.</p>

<span class="line"><span>sudo yum update      # command to update the repository in CentOS or Fedora</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>raco pkg update      # command in Racket to update all installed packages</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>These repositories are what make Linux a force to reckon with when it comes to software management with an element of security ensuring that the users only install software that is secure and reliable.</p>
