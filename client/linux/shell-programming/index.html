<p>Shell programming, also known as shell scripting, is an integral part of the Linux operating system. A shell script is essentially a program that the system’s shell executes. While it may not be as powerful as compiled languages like C or C++, shell programming is quite potent for administrative-level tasks, automating repetitive tasks, and system monitoring.</p>
<p>Most Linux distributions come with bash (Bourne Again Shell) as the default shell which is not only an excellent command-line shell, but also an outstanding scripting language. Shell scripts are generally written in a text editor and then can be run directly from the Linux command line.</p>
<p>A simple example of a bash shell script:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">#!/bin/bash</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4"># My first script</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD">echo</span><span style="color:#E9F284"> "</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">Hello, World!</span><span style="color:#E9F284">"</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>The ‘echo’ command prints its argument, in this case “Hello, World!”, to the terminal.</p>
