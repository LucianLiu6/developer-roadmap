<p>Linux servers are popular for their stability and flexibility, factors that make them a preferred choice for businesses and organizations when it comes to managing various services. Services that run under a Linux server can range from web services to database services, DNS servers, mail servers, and many others.</p>
<p>As a Linux system administrator, it’s important to periodically review these running services to manage resources, check their statuses, and troubleshoot issues, ensuring the health and performance of the server.</p>
<p>Linux has a variety of tools to achieve this, such as: <code>systemctl</code>, <code>service</code>, <code>netstat</code>, <code>ss</code> and <code>lsof</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the command <code>systemctl</code> is widely used on Linux systems to list all running services:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">systemctl</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --type=service</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> </span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command will show a list of all active services along with their current status. It is a necessity for server management and should be part of any Linux system administrator’s toolbox.</p>
