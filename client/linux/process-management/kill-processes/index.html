<p>On any Linux system, whether you’re on a server or a desktop system, processes are consistently running. Sometimes, these processes may not behave as expected due to certain reasons like system bugs, unexpected system behavior, or accidental initiation and may require termination. This is where the concept of killing processes in Linux comes to picture under the area of process management.</p>
<p>‘Kill’ in Linux is a built-in command that is used to terminate processes manually. You can use the <code>kill</code> command to send a specific signal to a process. When we use the <code>kill</code> command, we basically request a process to stop, pause, or terminate.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic illustration on how to use the <code>kill</code> command in Linux:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD">kill</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> [signal </span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">or</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> option]</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> PID</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">(</span><span style="color:#50FA7B">s</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>In practice, you would identify the Process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate and replace PID(s) in the above command. The signal or option part is optional, but very powerful allowing for specific termination actions.</p>
