<p>In Linux, process management is a fundamental part of the system which involves creating, scheduling, terminating and coordinating the execution of processes. One crucial aspect of this is proc signals or process signals.</p>
<p>Process signals are a form of communication mechanism in Unix and Linux systems. They provide a means to notify a process of synchronous or asynchronous events. There are a variety of signals like SIGINT, SIGSTOP, SIGKILL, etc. available which can be sent to a running process to interrupt, pause or terminate it.</p>
<p>For instance, to send a SIGSTOP signal to a process with a PID of 12345 you would use <code>kill</code> command in terminal as follows:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD">kill</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -SIGSTOP</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> 12345</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This will suspend the execution of the process until a SIGCONT signal is received.</p>
<p>Understanding proc signals is essential for comprehensive process management and resource allocation in Linux.</p>
