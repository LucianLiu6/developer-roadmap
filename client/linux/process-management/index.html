<p>Process management is integral part of any operating system and Linux is no different. Every program running on Linux, be it an application or a system operation, is treated as a process. These processes perform different tasks but work together to provide a seamless operating experience.</p>
<p>In Linux, users can interact and manage these processes by using different commands for various process management tasks such as viewing the currently running processes, killing processes, changing the priority of a process, and so on. Understanding these commands and how to use them effectively is essential to Linux process management.</p>
<p>The ps command for example, provides information about the currently running processes:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">ps</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> aux</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This will list out all the currently running processes with information such as the process ID, the user running that process, the CPU and memory itâ€™s consuming, the command that started the process, and more.</p>
<p><code>top</code> is another common command. It provides a live, updating view of the current state of the system including processes:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">top</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>Yet another powerful tool is <code>kill</code>, which can send specific signals to processes. For example, you can gracefully stop a process with <code>SIGTERM</code> (15) or forcefully stop one with <code>SIGKILL</code> (9):</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD">kill</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -SIGTERM</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> pid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#8BE9FD">kill</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -SIGKILL</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> pid</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>(note: you replace <code>pid</code> with the process ID you want to stop)</p>
