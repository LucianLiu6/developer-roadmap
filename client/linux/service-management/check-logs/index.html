<p>Checking Logs Under Service Management in Linux plays a vital role in systems administration and troubleshooting procedures. Logs are fundamental for an in-depth understanding of what’s going on inside a Linux system. These records provide a chronological record of events related to your system for use in debugging and troubleshooting problems.</p>
<p>Several essential logs generated by system processes, users and administrator actions can be found in <code>/var/log</code> directory. Logs can be accessed and viewed using several commands. For example, the <code>dmesg</code> command can be used to display the kernel ring buffer. Most system logs are managed by <code>systemd</code> and can be checked using the command <code>journalctl</code>.</p>

<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command will show the entire system log from the boot to the moment you’re calling the journal.</p>
<p>To display logs for a specific service, the <code>-u</code> option can be used followed by the service’s name.</p>

<p>Remember, understanding and monitoring your system logs will provide you a clear view of what’s going on in your Linux environment. It is a vital skill worth developing to effectively manage and troubleshoot systems.</p>
