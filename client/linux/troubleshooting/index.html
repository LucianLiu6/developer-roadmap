<p>Troubleshooting is an essential skill for any Linux user or administrator. This involves identifying and resolving problems or issues within a Linux system. These problems can range from common system errors, hardware or software issues, network connectivity problems, to management of system resources. The process of troubleshooting in Linux often involves the use of command-line tools, inspecting system and application log files, understanding system processes, and sometimes, deep diving into the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>The key to effective troubleshooting is understanding how Linux works and being familiar with the common command-line tools. Also, being able to interpret error messages, use Linuxâ€™s built-in debugging tools, and understand common problem symptoms can speed up resolution time.</p>
