<p>In the realm of Linux system administration and network troubleshooting, packet analysis is a key skill. It involves the use of tools and techniques to capture and analyze network traffic. By inspecting the data being sent and received over a network, system and network administrators can identify and troubleshoot issues such as poor performance, connectivity problems, and security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Tools like tcpdump and Wireshark are common utilities for this very purpose. They display packet-level details to provide a complete picture of network activities. These are particularly useful for network diagnostics and debugging issues related to network protocols.</p>
<p>A basic example of using tcpdump to capture packets in a Linux system command might look like this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="sh"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">sudo</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> tcpdump</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -i</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> eth0</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command captures and displays packets being transmitted or received over the <code>eth0</code> network interface.</p>
