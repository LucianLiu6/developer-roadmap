<p>Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used widely in Linux systems for troubleshooting. It is designed to display the path that packets take from the system where traceroute is run to a specified destination system or website. Itâ€™s used to identify routing problems, offer latency measurement, and figure out the network structure as packets journey across the internet.</p>
<p>Each jump along the route is tested multiple times (the default is 3 but this can be changed), and the round-trip time for each packet is displayed. If certain packets are failing to reach their destination, traceroute can help diagnose where the failure is occurring.</p>
<p>Tracing route in Linux can be achieved by executing the <code>traceroute</code> command which allows you to discover the routes that internet protocol packets follow when traveling to their destination.</p>
