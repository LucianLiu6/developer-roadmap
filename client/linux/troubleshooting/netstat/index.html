<p>Netstat, short for network statistics, is a built-in command-line tool used in Linux systems for network troubleshooting and performance measurement.  It provides statistics for protocols, a list of open ports, routing table information, and other important network details. Administrators and developers work with netstat to examine network issues and understand how a system communicates with others.</p>
<p>Its functionality is extended owing to various command-line options it supports, which could be used singularly or combinedly to fine-tune the output. These might include displaying numerical addresses instead of names (<code>-n</code>), continuous monitoring (<code>-c</code>), or spotting connections on a specific protocol (<code>-t</code>, <code>-u</code>).</p>
<p>Here is a brief snippet of how netstat may typically be used:</p>
