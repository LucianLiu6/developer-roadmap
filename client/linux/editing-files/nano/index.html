<p>Nano is a popular, user-friendly text editor used for creating and editing files directly within the Linux command line interface (CLI). It is an alternative to editors like Vi and Emacs and is considered more straightforward for beginners due to its simple and intuitive interface.</p>
<p>Nano comes pre-installed with many Linux distributions and can be used for various tasks, such as writing scripts, editing configuration files, or taking quick notes. With its interactive command line interface, Nano offers a unique blend of usability and functionality.</p>
<p>To use Nano to edit or create files in Linux, the following command can be used:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">nano</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> filename</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>This command opens the named file or creates a new one if it doesnâ€™t exist yet. All the editing is done within the terminal itself. While using Nano, the command options are always visible at the bottom of the screen, making it an excellent choice for Linux beginners or those preferring straightforward text editing tools.</p>
