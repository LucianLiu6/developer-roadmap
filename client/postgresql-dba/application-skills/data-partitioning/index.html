<p>Data partitioning is a technique that divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Each partition is a smaller table that stores a subset of the data, usually based on specific criteria such as ranges, lists, or hashes. Partitioning can improve query performance, simplifies data maintenance tasks, and optimizes resource utilization.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL supports different partitioning methods, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Range Partitioning:</strong> The data in a range-partitioned table is separated into partitions based on a specified range of values for a given column. For example, orders could be partitioned by date range, with each partition containing orders within a specific date interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>List Partitioning:</strong> The data in a list-partitioned table is separated into partitions based on specified discrete sets of values for a given column. For example, customers could be partitioned by their country, with each partition storing customers from a specific country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash Partitioning:</strong> The data in a hash-partitioned table is divided into partitions using a hash function applied to one or more columns. This method distributes data uniformly across all partitions, which helps in load balancing and parallel query processing. For example, products could be hash partitioned based on the product ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
