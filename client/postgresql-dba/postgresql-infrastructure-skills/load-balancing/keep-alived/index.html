<p><a href="https://www.keepalived.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Keepalived</a> is a robust and widely-used open-source solution for load balancing and high availability. It helps to maintain a stable and perfect working environment even in the presence of failures such as server crashes or connectivity issues.</p>
<p>Keepalived achieves this by utilizing the <a href="https://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Linux Virtual Server</a> (LVS) module and the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Keepalived provides a powerful framework to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and minimizing server response time.</li>
<li><strong>High Availability</strong>: It uses VRRP to manage the state of various network interfaces and monitor the health of backing servers. This enables quick failover switching between active and backup servers in case of failure to maintain uninterrupted service.</li>
<li><strong>Health-Checking</strong>: Keepalived has a built-in health-checking mechanism that continuously monitors the backend servers, marking them up or down based on their availability, and adjusting the load balancing accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration Flexibility</strong>: Its configuration file format is simple yet powerful, catering to a wide range of use cases, network environments, and load balancing algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integration-with-postgresql">Integration with PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>For PostgreSQL database systems, Keepalived can be an advantageous addition to your infrastructure by offering fault tolerance and load balancing. With minimal configuration, it distributes read-only queries among multiple replicated PostgreSQL servers or divides transaction processing across various nodes â€“ ensuring an efficient and resilient system.</p>
<p>To achieve that, you need to set up a Keepalived instance on each PostgreSQL server, and configure them with appropriate settings for load balancing and high availability. Make sure to correctly configure the health-checking options to monitor the status of each PostgreSQL server, ensuring prompt action on any anomalies.</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive grasp of Keepalived and its integration with PostgreSQL, follow the <a href="https://www.keepalived.org/documentation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official documentation</a> and specific <a href="https://severalnines.com/database-blog/how-set-postgresql-load-balancing-keepalived-and-haproxy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">tutorials</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, Keepalived ensures your PostgreSQL system remains performant and available even in the face of server failures or connectivity issues. By implementing load balancing, high availability, and health-checking mechanisms, it stands as a reliable choice to bolster your PostgreSQL infrastructure.</p>
