<p>Zabbix is an open-source, distributed monitoring solution designed to monitor and track the status of network services, servers, and other IT components. It is highly scalable and can easily handle thousands of devices in its database. Zabbix uses a flexible notification and alerting mechanism, which allows users to configure e-mail or other media types for various events. The system is also capable of visualizing the gathered data, providing real-time graphs and maps for a better understanding of the network state.</p>
