<p>Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) is a technique used by PostgreSQL to allow multiple transactions to access the same data concurrently without conflicts or delays. It ensures that each transaction has a consistent snapshot of the database and can operate on its own version of the data.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-mvcc">Key Features of MVCC</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction isolation</strong>: Each transaction has its own isolated view of the database, which prevents them from seeing each other’s uncommitted data (called a snapshot).</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: MVCC allows multiple transactions to run concurrently without affecting each other’s operations, thus improving system performance.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: MVCC ensures that when a transaction accesses data, it always has a consistent view, even if other transactions are modifying the data at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-mvcc-works">How MVCC Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a transaction starts, it gets a unique transaction ID (TXID). This ID is later used to keep track of changes made by the transaction.</li>
<li>When a transaction reads data, it only sees the data that was committed before the transaction started, as well as any changes it made itself. This ensures that every transaction has a consistent view of the database.</li>
<li>Whenever a transaction modifies data (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE), PostgreSQL creates a new version of the affected rows and assigns the new version the same TXID as the transaction. These new versions are called “tuples”.</li>
<li>Other transactions running at the same time will only see the old versions of the modified rows since their snapshots are still based on the earlier state of the data.</li>
<li>When a transaction is committed, PostgreSQL checks for conflicts (such as two transactions trying to modify the same row). If there are no conflicts, the changes are permanently applied to the database, and other transactions can now see the updated data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-mvcc">Benefits of MVCC</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>High performance</strong>: With MVCC, reads and writes can occur simultaneously without locking, leading to improved performance, especially in highly concurrent systems.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent data</strong>: Transactions always work on a consistent snapshot of the data, ensuring that the data is never corrupted by concurrent changes.</li>
<li><strong>Increased isolation</strong>: MVCC provides a strong level of isolation between transactions, which helps prevent errors caused by concurrent updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drawbacks-of-mvcc">Drawbacks of MVCC</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased complexity</strong>: Implementing MVCC in a database system requires more complex data structures and algorithms compared to traditional locking mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Storage overhead</strong>: Multiple versions of each data item must be stored, which can lead to increased storage usage and maintenance overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, MVCC is an essential component of PostgreSQL’s transaction management, providing a highly efficient and consistent system for managing concurrent database changes.</p>
