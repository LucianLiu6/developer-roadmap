<p><code>ListView</code> in Android is a view which groups several items and displays them in vertical scrollable list. The list items are automatically inserted to the list using an <code>Adapter</code> that pulls content from a source such as an array or database query and converts each item result into a view thatâ€™s placed into the list. It is widely used in android apps as it offers an easy way to display a list of data in an organized manner. Functions such as <code>setAdapter(Adapter)</code> to specify data source, <code>setOnItemClickListener(OnItemClickListener)</code> to listen for click events on items, and <code>setOnScrollListener(OnScrollListener)</code> to listen for scroll events, provide further control over the list behavior.</p>
