<p>In Android, animations are used to give a more visual, dynamic, and interactive aspect to a static user interface. Android offers four categories of animation APIs in order to create and manage the animations. These are: <strong>Property Animation</strong>: This allows modification of properties of an object over a given time period. <strong>View Animation</strong>: Consists of two subcategories i.e. Tween Animation (transition of a view from one state to another) and Frame Animation (displaying frames one after another). <strong>Drawable Animation</strong>: This is similar to a slideshow, showing one image after another. Lastly, <strong>Layout Animation</strong>: This is used to animate the layout itself when views are added or removed.</p>
<p>You can utilize Androidâ€™s built-in animations or fully customize your own to add unique transitions and movements in your applications. Every app can benefit from a touch of animation to create a more immersive and pleasant user experience.</p>
