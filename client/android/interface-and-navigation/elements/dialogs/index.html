<p>Dialogs in Android are small windows that prompt users to make a decision or enter additional information. They don’t fill the screen and are normally used for modal events that require users to take action before they can proceed. In Android, <code>Dialog</code> is actually an abstract class directly subclassed from <code>Object</code>. <code>AlertDialog</code> is the subclass that you will most commonly use, which contains a number of methods as compared to <code>Dialog</code> to support features like lists, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a custom layout design. They are typically used for user interactions such as warnings, notifications, and menus.</p>
<p>To create a dialog, you must use the <code>Dialog</code> class or one of its subclasses, such as <code>DialogFragment</code> or <code>AlertDialog</code>. For a more detailed explanation on implementing dialogs in Android, you can refer to the official Android Developer’s Guide.</p>
