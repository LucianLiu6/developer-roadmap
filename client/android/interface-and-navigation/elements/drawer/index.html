<p>The <code>Drawer</code> in Android is a slide-out menu that enables users to navigate between different parts of an application. It is usually triggered by a hamburger icon in the app’s top-left corner. The <code>Drawer</code> can contain a list of options, subheadings, and separators to articulate the app’s structure. In Android, this component can be implemented using <code>DrawerLayout</code> and <code>NavigationView</code>. The <code>DrawerLayout</code> is the parent component and <code>NavigationView</code> is typically placed within the <code>DrawerLayout</code>. One key thing to note is that the <code>Drawer</code> should not be used as the only means of navigating through an application, according to Android’s design guidelines.</p>
