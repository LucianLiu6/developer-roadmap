<p><code>Toast</code> in Android is a simple message that appears on the screen for a short period of time then disappears automatically. It is generally used to provide feedback to the user about an operation in a small popup without requiring any user interaction. This feedback could be an error message or simply information that a process completed successfully. You can configure the toast to appear anywhere on the screen and specify how long it stays up. In order to use a toast, you have to import the <code>android.widget.Toast</code> package and instantiate a Toast object. Hereâ€™s an example of creating a simple toast: <code>Toast.makeText(context, text, duration).show()</code>, where context is your application context, text is the message to display, and duration is either <code>Toast.LENGTH_SHORT</code> or <code>Toast.LENGTH_LONG</code>.</p>
