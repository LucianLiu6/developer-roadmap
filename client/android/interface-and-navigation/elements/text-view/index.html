<p><code>TextView</code> in Android is a UI (User Interface) element that allows you to display text to the user. You can set the text to be displayed by declaring it in XML or introducing it programmatically. This element supports various attributes such as <code>android:textAllCaps</code>, <code>android:textAppearance</code>, <code>android:textColor</code>, etc., to customize its appearance. Each <code>TextView</code> corresponds to an <code>android.widget.TextView</code> object. You can also react to user interaction events such as touch or click with the help of listeners (like <code>View.onClickListener</code> or <code>View.onTouchListener</code>). Manipulating with <code>TextView</code> is common when creating Android apps as they form the basic building block for user interface components.</p>
