<p><code>EditText</code> is a common element used in Android development. Itâ€™s a fundamental component for accepting user input in simple form or dialog. It allows users to modify text within its bounding box, much like what a TextField does in more general programming languages. If you have used a form or a webpage that allows you to input text, it was probably created with an EditText or similar control. You can customize an <code>EditText</code> in various ways including size, color, initial text, and hint text. You can also listen for changes in the text in an EditText, apply filters, specify input types, and more. The <code>android:text</code> attribute lets you pre-fill the EditText with text, and <code>android:hint</code> provides hint text when the EditText is empty.</p>
