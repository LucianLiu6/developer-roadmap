<p>Asynchronism in Android is a practice that defines operations, which can run independently from the main operation without following the programâ€™s linear flow. The Android system uses threads to handle asynchronous processes. These threads function independently, ensuring that complex or time-consuming operations do not interfere with the user interface or other essential parts of the application. Android provides various tools for carrying out asynchronous tasks, such as <code>Handler</code>, <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, <code>IntentService</code>, <code>AsyncTask</code>, and <code>Loader</code> etc. These tools provide ways to execute tasks on different threads and communicate the results back to the main thread.</p>
