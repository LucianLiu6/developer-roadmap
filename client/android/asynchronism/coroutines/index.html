<p>In Android, <code>coroutines</code> refer to a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. <code>Coroutines</code> provide a way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a natural, sequential manner. The fundamental building blocks of <code>coroutines</code> are <code>suspend</code> functions which are simply functions that can be paused and resumed at later times. They are the key to writing non-blocking asynchronous code and represent a single unit of asynchronous computation. This aspect of <code>coroutines</code> makes them useful for managing long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your application to become unresponsive.</p>
