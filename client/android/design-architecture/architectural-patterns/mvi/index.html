<p>”MVI” stands for Model-View-Intent, and is an architectural pattern used in Android development. This pattern introduces a unidirectional data flow which makes it easier to understand an app’s state at any given point in time. In the MVI pattern, the <code>Intent</code> represents an intention or desire to perform an action, often triggered by user inputs. The <code>View</code> is responsible for rendering the UI and emitting intents. The <code>Model</code>, on the other hand, represents the state of the app and reacts to intents by changing its state. It’s the Model’s responsibility to respond to each Intent with a resulting new state. Once a new state is created, it is published back to the <code>View</code>. This clear separation and single direction of data and event flow can help in managing side-effects and handling asynchronous actions.</p>
