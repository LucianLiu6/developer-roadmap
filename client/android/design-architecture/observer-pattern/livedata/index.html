<p><code>LiveData</code> is a data holder class that can be observed within a given lifecycle. This means that an <code>Observer</code> can be added in a pair with a <code>LifecycleOwner</code>, and this observer will be notified about modifications of the <code>LiveData</code> object only if the associated <code>LifecycleOwner</code> is in active state. <code>LiveData</code> respects the lifecycle state of app components, such as activities, fragments, or services, and it only updates app-component observers that are in an active lifecycle state. Furthermore, <code>LiveData</code> automatically removes the observers when their associated <code>LifecycleOwner</code> moves to the <code>Destroyed</code> state. This combination of <code>LiveData</code> and <code>LifecycleOwner</code> helps you to manage appropriate and efficient updates because <code>LiveData</code> takes into consideration the lifecycle state of your app components.</p>
