<p><code>Flow</code> in Android development is part of the Kotlin Coroutines library. It is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, making it perfect for working with any data streams or any streams of events that arenâ€™t instantaneous. Like Observables, <code>Flow</code> is also based on the observer pattern, meaning it can emit values and these emissions can be observed and reacted to. However, <code>Flow</code> comes with built-in backpressure handling and the ability to transform, filter, or combine these flows in a sequence. Along with Coroutines, <code>Flow</code> encourages a more predictable and simplified concurrency design without callback hell problem.</p>
