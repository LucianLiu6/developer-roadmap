<p>The <strong>Builder Pattern</strong> in Android is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation. The pattern involves a <code>Builder</code> class which is used to construct the <code>Product</code> class. The Builder class typically has a method for each part that may be used to construct a Product. It also has a method for returning the final product. The Builder pattern is useful in situations where you might have multiple ways to create an object or when an object requires a large number of parameters for its constructor.</p>
