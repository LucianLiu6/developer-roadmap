<p>In Android, <strong>Design Architecture</strong> refers to structuring the code in a way that increases its readability, maintainability, and testability. There are several ways to design architecture like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model-View-Presenter (MVP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</a>, and <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/817602-mvi-architecture-for-android-tutorial-getting-started" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Model-View-Intent (MVI)</a>. Each of these define the interaction between the data, the logic, and the UI layers. Googleâ€™s recommended architectural pattern is <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Android Architecture Components</a> which follow the principles of the MVVM pattern. Bear in mind that an architecture is not a rigid structure that fits all solutions. Rather, it serves as a guideline and can be tweaked as necessary.</p>
