<p><code>DataStore</code> is a new and improved data storage solution by Android, meant to supersede <code>SharedPreferences</code>. It is important to understand that it comes in two different implementations: <code>Preferences DataStore</code> and <code>Proto DataStore</code>. <code>Preferences DataStore</code> uses key-value pairs similar to <code>SharedPreferences</code>, but itâ€™s more robust and handles runtime exceptions more efficiently. On the other hand, <code>Proto DataStore</code> uses custom data types to provide type safety. It lets you leverage the power of Protocol Buffers, a language-neutral, platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data, as the data storage format. Operating on data in <code>DataStore</code> is transactional, meaning that if an error occurs during an operation, all changes are rolled back, so the data remains in a consistent state.</p>
