<p>Shared Preferences in Android are used to store data in key-value pairs. It works similar to a tiny database where you can save small pieces of data such as settings or the state of an application. When data is saved to Shared Preferences, it persists across user sessions, even if your application is killed or gets deleted. Data in Shared Preferences is not typically used for large amounts of data. To perform actions such as saving, retrieving, or editing data in Shared Preferences, you use an instance of <code>SharedPreferences.Editor</code>.</p>
