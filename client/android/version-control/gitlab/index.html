<p><code>Gitlab</code> is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool which provides a Git-repository manager, along with continuous integration and deployment pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc. Users can manage and create their software projects and repositories, and collaborate on these projects with other members. <code>Gitlab</code> also allows users to view analytics and open issues of their project. It stands next to other version control tools like <code>GitHub</code> and <code>Bitbucket</code>, but comes with its own set of additional features and nuances. For Android development, <code>Gitlab</code> can be particularly useful owing to its continuous integration and deployment system which can automate large parts of the app testing and deployment.</p>
