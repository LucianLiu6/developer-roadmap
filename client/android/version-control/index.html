<p><em>Version Control</em> is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. An essential tool for software development, it helps to track changes, enhance collaboration, and manage different versions of a project. Two common types of version control systems are Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). CVCS uses a central server to store all versions of a project, with users getting snapshots from that server. Examples include SVN and Perforce. On the other hand, DVCS allows multiple developers to work on a single project simultaneously. Each user has a complete backup of all versions of the work. Examples include Git and Mercurial.</p>
