<p><code>Kotlin</code> is a cross-platform, statically typed general-purpose programming language with type inference. Developed by JetBrains, the makers of the world’s leading IDEs, Kotlin has a syntax, which is more expressive and concise. This allows for more readable and maintainable code. It is fully interoperable with Java and comes with no limitations. It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today, for server-side development, Android apps, and much more. Kotlin introduces several improvements for programmers over Java, which makes it a preferred choice for many developers. With more concise code base and modern programming concept support - it’s certainly a future of Android app development.</p>
