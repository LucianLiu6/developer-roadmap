<p>In Android development, understanding the <code>Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</code> is crucial. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses “Objects” - entities that contain both data and functions that manipulate the data. Key concepts include <code>Classes</code>, which are blueprints from which objects are created; <code>Objects</code>, instances of a class; <code>Inheritance</code>, where one class acquires properties from another; <code>Polymorphism</code>, the ability of an object to take many forms; <code>Abstraction</code>, showing only necessary details and hiding implementation from the user; and <code>Encapsulation</code>, the concept of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. By understanding these fundamentals, you can create more efficient and effective Android apps.</p>
