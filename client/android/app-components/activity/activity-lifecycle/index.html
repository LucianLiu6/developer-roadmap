<p>The <strong>Activity Lifecycle</strong> in Android represents a series of states or events that an activity can go through from its creation to its destruction. The primary states or events are <code>onCreate()</code>, <code>onStart()</code>, <code>onResume()</code>, <code>onPause()</code>, <code>onStop()</code>, <code>onDestroy()</code>, and <code>onRestart()</code>. The method <code>onCreate()</code> is called when the activity is first created, followed by <code>onStart()</code> when the activity becomes visible to the user. The <code>onResume()</code> method executes when the user starts interacting with the application. <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onStop()</code> methods are invoked when the application is no longer in the foreground or visible to the user. The <code>onDestroy()</code> method is used when the activity is being completely removed from the memory. The <code>onRestart()</code> method is called after the system stops the activity and is about to start it again. The proper handling of these states ensures the efficient use of resources and a smooth user experience.</p>
