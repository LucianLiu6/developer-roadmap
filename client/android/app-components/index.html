<p>Android apps are primarily made up of five different types of components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Activities</strong>: These are individual screens that a user can interact with. Any UI action like touching a button or swiping a screen will usually take place within an activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services</strong>: Unlike activities, services run in the background and don’t have a user interface. They’re used for repetitive or long running operations, like playing music or pulling in a feed of data from a server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast Receivers</strong>: These are event listeners. The Android operating system uses them to respond to system-wide events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Providers</strong>: They manage and share app data with other apps installed on the device. For security, data is not generally shared across apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intents</strong>: These serve as messages or commands to the Android system. They’re used to signal to the Android system that certain events have occurred.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each app component is designed to serve different purposes and to have a well-defined lifecycle which defines how the component is created and destroyed.</p>
