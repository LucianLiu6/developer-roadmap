<p><strong>Broadcast Receivers</strong> in Android are components that respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. They can be registered to respond to a specific type of broadcasts or implement a user-defined broadcast. While you can initiate a broadcast from your app, they are generally used for receiving system notifications or communicating with other applications. However, keep in mind that they cannot display a user interface, but they can start activities if necessary, which do have a user interface. A <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> class must override the <code>onReceive()</code> method where each message is received as an <code>Intent</code> object parameter.</p>
