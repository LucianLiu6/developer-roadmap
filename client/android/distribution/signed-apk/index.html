<p>A <strong>Signed APK</strong> is a version of your app that you prepare for distribution in the Play Store or other Android markets. When you sign your app using a private key, you authenticate your identity as the developer of the app. It is a required step by the Android system that ensures only updates to the APK that are from the original developer will be accepted. The Android system refuses to install an app if itâ€™s not signed appropriately, thereby protecting users from potential security risks. Please make sure that you keep your private key in a safe place for future updates to your app, losing it would imply that you cannot update your app anymore.</p>
