<p>Spring Cloud Hystrix is a library for managing the fault tolerance of microservices-based applications using the Circuit Breaker pattern. It is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable. You can use it to easily instrument your code and monitor the health of your microservices using Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer. It also provides a consistent programming model across different libraries, and allows developers to use annotations to enable circuit breaker functionality.</p>
