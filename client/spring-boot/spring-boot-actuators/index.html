<p>Spring Boot Actuators are a set of production-ready features in Spring Boot that allow you to monitor and manage your application in various ways. They provide a variety of endpoints that expose information about the health and performance of your application, and allow you to perform various management tasks such as shutting down the application or refreshing its configuration.</p>
<p>Some of the key features of Spring Boot Actuators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health endpoint: Exposes information about the health of the application, such as whether it is up and running, and any issues it may be experiencing.</li>
<li>Metrics endpoint: Exposes metrics about the performance of the application, such as CPU and memory usage, and number of requests handled.</li>
<li>Info endpoint: Exposes arbitrary information about the application, such as version number, and build information.</li>
<li>Configuration endpoint: Exposes information about the configuration of the application, such as the properties and their values.</li>
<li>Actuator endpoints can be secured, rate-limited and customized with various options and properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spring Boot Actuators are typically used in production environments to monitor the health and performance of an application and identify any issues that may arise. They can also be used in development and testing environments to gain insight into the internal workings of the application.</p>
