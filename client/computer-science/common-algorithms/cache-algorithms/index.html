<p>Cache algorithms are used to manage the cache memory of a computer. Cache memory is a small amount of memory that is used to store data that is frequently accessed. This allows the computer to access the data faster than if it had to go to the main memory. Cache algorithms are used to determine which data should be stored in the cache memory and which data should be removed from the cache memory.</p>
