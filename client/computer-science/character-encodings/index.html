<p>Character encodings are a way of representing characters as numbers. They are used to store and transmit text. The most common character encoding is ASCII, which is a 7-bit encoding. This means that each character is represented by a number between 0 and 127. The ASCII character set contains 128 characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and control characters. The ASCII character set is a subset of the Unicode character set, which is a 16-bit encoding. Unicode is a superset of ASCII, so ASCII characters can be represented by Unicode. Unicode is the most common character encoding used on the web.</p>
