<p>CPU Scheduling is the process of selecting a process from the ready queue and allocating the CPU to it. The selection of a process is based on a particular scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm is chosen depending on the type of system and the requirements of the processes.</p>
<p>Here is the list of some of the most commonly used scheduling algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Come First Serve (FCFS):</strong> The process that arrives first is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Shortest Job First (SJF):</strong> The process with the smallest execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):</strong> The process with the smallest remaining execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Round Robin (RR):</strong> The process is allocated the CPU for a fixed time slice. The time slice is usually 10 milliseconds. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Priority Scheduling:</strong> The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-level Queue Scheduling:</strong> The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling:</strong> The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Lottery Scheduling:</strong> The process is allocated the CPU based on a lottery system. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:</strong> The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.</li>
</ul>
