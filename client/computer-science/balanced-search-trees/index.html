<p>Balanced search trees are a type of data structure that allow for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of data. They are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, which means that they are a binary tree that maintains the binary search tree property while also keeping the tree balanced. This means that the tree is always approximately balanced, which allows for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of data.</p>
