<p>Please note that this is a study plan for Computer Science, not web development, we have <a href="/">separate roadmaps for web development</a>. Also, note that this is not an exhaustive list and is a highly opinionated list of topics.</p>
<p>We are continuously working on improving the roadmaps. Please <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues" target="_blank">create an issue with your suggestions</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kamrify" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">reach out to me on twitter</a> with your feedback and suggestions for improving this roadmap further.</p>
