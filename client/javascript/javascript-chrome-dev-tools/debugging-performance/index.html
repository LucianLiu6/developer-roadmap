<p>Enter the dev tools and check out the Lighthouse tab. This is essentially a series of tests which analyses the currently open website on a bunch of metrics related to performance, page speed, accessibility, etc. Feel free to run the tests by clicking the <strong>Analyse Page Load</strong> button (you might want to do this in an incognito tab to avoid errors arising from extensions youâ€™re using). Once you have the results, take your time and read through them (and do click through to the reference pages mentioned alongside each test result to know more about it!)</p>
