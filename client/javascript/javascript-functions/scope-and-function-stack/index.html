<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>A space or environment in which a particular variable or function can be accessed or used. Accessibility of this variable or function depends on where it is defined.</p>
<p>JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global scope</strong>: The default scope for all code running in script mode.</li>
<li><strong>Module scope</strong>: The scope for code running in module mode.</li>
<li><strong>Function scope</strong>: The scope created with a function.</li>
<li><strong>Block scope</strong>: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="function-stack-call-stack">Function Stack (Call stack)</h2>
<p>The function stack is how the interpreter keeps track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions, like which function is currently executing and which functions within that function are being called.</p>
