<p>The comma operator (<code>,</code>) evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. This lets you create a compound expression in which multiple expressions are evaluated, with the compound expressionâ€™s final value being the value of the rightmost of its member expressions. This is commonly used to provide multiple parameters to a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
