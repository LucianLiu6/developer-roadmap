<p>At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The expression <code>x = 7</code> is an example of the first type. This expression uses the <code>=</code> operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7. The expression <code>3 + 4</code> is an example of the second type. This expression uses the <code>+</code> operator to add <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> together and produces a value, <code>7</code>. However, if it’s not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like <code>const z = 3 + 4</code>), its result will be immediately discarded <code>—</code> this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn’t produce any effects. As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as <code>=</code> and <code>+</code>.</p>
