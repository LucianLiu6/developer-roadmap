<p>An input radio is a form element used for selecting one option from a list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checked State:</strong> Used when the radio is selected and will use its value for the form submission. A radio input canâ€™t be unselected by pressing it again.</li>
<li><strong>Disabled State:</strong> Prevents radio interactions and removes its value from the form submission.</li>
<li><strong>Label:</strong> There should be a text label linked with the radio field. Clicking the label should also trigger the radio selection.</li>
<li><strong>Error State:</strong> The error state is used for form validation errors when the error is related to the radio field only. Always use a text error along with changing the colour of the field.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard State:</strong> A radio selection should be triggered when the Space key is pressed. Using native elements for this should provide this kind of interaction out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Radio Group:</strong> Radio inputs should always be used in a group. If one of them is selected, it can be deselected only by choosing another radio.</li>
</ul>
