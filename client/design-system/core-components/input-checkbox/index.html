<p>An input checkbox is a form element used for selecting one or multiple options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checked State:</strong> Used when the checkbox is selected and will use its value for the form submission.</li>
<li><strong>Disabled State:</strong> Prevents checkbox interactions and removes its value from the form submission.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate State:</strong> Used when the checkbox has children selectable elements and only some of them are selected.</li>
<li><strong>Label:</strong> There should be a text label linked with the checkbox field. Clicking the label should also trigger the checkbox selection.</li>
<li><strong>Error State:</strong> The error state is used for form validation errors when the error is related to the checkbox field only. Always use a text error along with changing the colour of the field.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard State:</strong> Checkbox selections should be triggered with the Space key. Using native elements for this should provide this kind of interaction out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Checkbox Group:</strong> Checkboxes can be grouped to work with multiple values at the same time.</li>
</ul>
