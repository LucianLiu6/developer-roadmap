<p>The loading indicator shows that an operation’s being performed and how long the process will take.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear and non-linear Variants:</strong> Depending on the context and the component it’s used for, the loading indicator can be represented either with linear or with a non-linear (e.g. circular) variant.</li>
<li><strong>Determinate or indeterminate wait time:</strong> In some cases, the wait time can’t be determined. The loading indicator should be shown until the loading finishes or an error happens. In other cases, it’s better to indicate how much time’s left until the loading is done.</li>
<li><strong>Light Variant:</strong> The loading indicator should respect its parent element background and provide a variant to be used on darker background colours.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Motion:</strong> The loading indicator should be synced with the system motion settings and reduce its animation speed when reduced motion settings are turned on.</li>
</ul>
