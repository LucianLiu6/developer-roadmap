<p>Lists define the layout of the page content or groups of elements stacking them vertically or horizontally.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support any type of content:</strong> Lists can be used in any context from page-level layout to managing offsets between granular components. hey should work with any component used inside.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Stacking:</strong> Lists can be used for inline elements and they have to manage how theyâ€™re stacked horizontally, including handling offsets between multiple rows of elements.</li>
<li><strong>Divided Variant:</strong> Lists with dividers are the best practice advised by many platform guidelines (especially on mobile).</li>
<li><strong>Supports Actionable Content:</strong> Sometimes lists are used for grouping tappable components, where the whole area of the list item should be clickable.</li>
