<p>Dropdowns are used to display a contextual subview with a list of actions or content related to the area where the dropdown is.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supports any type of content:</strong> Dropdowns may be used in a lot of contexts like date pickers, language selection or other product features.</li>
<li><strong>Action Menu:</strong> One of the most used scenarios for dropdowns is providing an action menu for the user, so it’s useful to have this layout defined.</li>
<li><strong>Focus Trapping:</strong> Once the dropdown’s opened, the focus should work only for elements inside the dropdown. When it’s closed, the focus should move to the dropdown trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Close Action:</strong> Either some actions inside the dropdown should close it or there should be a separate close button. Also, it’s good practice to close the dropdown when a user clicks outside.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> It should be possible to navigate through dropdown children elements with the keyboard and close it with an Esc key.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Position:</strong> Dropdown content should be displayed based on the current position of the trigger element on the screen and always visible to the user.</li>
<li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Dropdown content should be adapted for mobile viewpoints as it may take a lot of space on desktops.</li>
</ul>
