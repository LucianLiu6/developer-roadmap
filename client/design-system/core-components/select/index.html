<p>Select lets user select a value from a list of values in a form context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disabled State:</strong> Prevents input interactions and removes its value from the form submission.</li>
<li><strong>Placeholder:</strong> When there’s no value entered, show a placeholder with a potential value example. Don’t use placeholders as labels for the inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Label:</strong> There should be a text label linked with the text field. Clicking the label should move the focus to the field.</li>
<li><strong>Error State:</strong> The error state is used for form validation errors when the error is related to the text field only. Always use a text error along with changing the colour of the field.</li>
<li><strong>Focused State:</strong> The focused state should highlight the text field when users start to interact with it. There is always only one focused field in the form.</li>
<li><strong>Autocomplete:</strong> When applicable, adding support for the HTML autocomplete attribute will allow users to easily enter different data types.</li>
<li><strong>Icon Support:</strong> Icons are used to describe input methods, express a text field state or provide additional functionality.</li>
</ul>
