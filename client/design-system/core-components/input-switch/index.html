<p>Input switches toggle the state of a single item. Compared to the input checkbox, their changes usually apply without any additional submission.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checked State:</strong> Used when an input switch is turned on. Itâ€™s better to provide an additional way to indicate the checked state besides changing its colour when applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Disabled State:</strong> Prevents interacting with an input switch.</li>
<li><strong>Label:</strong> There should be a text label linked with the switch field. Clicking the label should also trigger the input selection.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard State:</strong> A switch selection should be triggered when the Space key is pressed.</li>
</ul>
